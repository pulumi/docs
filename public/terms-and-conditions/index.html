                <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
                <p><h2 class="h4">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENERAL TERMS</h2>
<p>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your use of the Pulumi Services is governed by this Agreement (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;). &ldquo;Pulumi&rdquo; means Pulumi Corporation, located at 1525 4th Avenue, Suite 800, Seattle, WA 98101 and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Pulumi Services. The “Pulumi Services” means the services Pulumi makes available through this website, the Pulumi platform, and any other software or services offered by Pulumi in connection to any of those.</p>
<p>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to use the Pulumi Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Pulumi Services. You understand and agree that Pulumi will treat your use of the Pulumi Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>
<p>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not use the Pulumi Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Pulumi Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Pulumi Services.</p>
<p>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that purchases of Pulumi Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Pulumi or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.</p>
<br />
<h2 class="h4">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USE OF THE PULUMI SERVICES</h2>
<p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you register to use the Pulumi Services. You are responsible for the security of passwords and for any use of your account.</p>
<p>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your use of the Pulumi Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.</p>
<p>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Pulumi Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Pulumi in connection with the Pulumi Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Pulumi, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Pulumi Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).</p>
<p>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your account’s Service Capacity has “hard” and “soft” usage limits, as set forth on the Order Form and further explained at <a href="/acceptable-use#quota">https://www.pulumi.com/acceptable-use#quota</a>. The Pulumi Services do not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits. Pulumi reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion. Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account.</p>
<br />
<h2 class="h4">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SERVICES POLICIES AND PRIVACY</h2>
<p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You agree to comply with the Pulumi Acceptable Use Policy available at <a href="/acceptable-use">https://www.pulumi.com/acceptable-use</a> (the &ldquo;Acceptable Use Policy&rdquo;) which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.</p>
<p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pulumi Services shall be subject to the privacy policy available at <a href="/privacy">https://www.pulumi.com/privacy</a>. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with such privacy policy.</p>
<p>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulumi shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Pulumi Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for planned downtime (of which you are given notice), or any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Pulumi’s reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of God, acts of government, floods, fires, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems (other than those involving Pulumi employees), Internet service provider failures or delays, or denial of service attacks.</p>
<br />
<h2 class="h4">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAYMENT OF FEES</h2>
<p>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will pay Pulumi the then applicable fees described in the Order Form for the Pulumi Services and Implementation Services in accordance with the terms therein (the “Fees”).  If your use of the Services exceeds the Service Capacity set forth on the Order Form or otherwise requires the payment of additional fees (per the terms of this Agreement), you will be billed for such usage and you agree to pay the additional fees in the manner provided herein.  Pulumi reserves the right to change the Fees or applicable charges and to institute new charges and Fees at the end of the Initial Service Term or then current renewal term, upon thirty (30) days prior notice to you (which may be sent by email). If you believe that Pulumi has billed you incorrectly, you must contact Pulumi no later than 60 days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive an adjustment or credit.  Inquiries should be directed to Pulumi’s customer support department.</p>
<p>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulumi may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by Pulumi thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the invoice.  Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of your account. You are responsible for all taxes associated with Pulumi Services other than U.S. taxes based on Pulumi’s net income.</p>
<p>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any charge owed by you is 30 days or more overdue, Pulumi may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your access to Pulumi Services until such amounts are paid in full, provided we have given you 10 or more days&rsquo; prior notice that your account is overdue.</p>
<p>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise stated, Pulumi’s fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including but not limited to value-added, sales and use, or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, &ldquo;Taxes&rdquo;). You are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchases hereunder. If Pulumi has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this paragraph, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by you, unless you provide Pulumi with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, Pulumi is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property and employees.</p>
<p>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not develop Cloud Applications, as defined in 5.2, to simulate, act, or otherwise access the Pulumi Services to avoid incurring fees associated with exceeding the hard and soft limits outlined in your Pulumi Services Order Form.</p>
<br />
<h2 class="h4">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTENT AND CLOUD APPLICATIONS</h2>
<p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) to which you may have access to as part of, or through your use of, the Pulumi Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the &ldquo;Content.&rdquo; The term Content shall specifically exclude applications that you create using the Pulumi Services and any source code written by you to be used with the Pulumi Services (collectively, &ldquo;Cloud Applications&rdquo;).</p>
<p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are solely responsible for (and Pulumi has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) the Cloud Applications or any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Pulumi Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Pulumi may suffer) by doing so.</p>
<p>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You agree that Pulumi has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content and other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Pulumi Services.

<p>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in Section 8, Pulumi acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content or Cloud Applications that you create, submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Pulumi Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content and the Cloud Application (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).

<br />
<h2 class="h4">12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
<p>12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulumi agrees to indemnify you against any losses or damages finally awarded against you incurred in connection with a third party claim alleging that your use of the Pulumi Services infringes or misappropriates any U.S. patent, copyright, or trade secret of such third party, provided that you (a) provide prompt written notice of such claim to Pulumi, (b) grant Pulumi the sole right to defend such claim, and &copy; provide to Pulumi all reasonable assistance.

<p>14.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulumi may make changes to the Terms from time to time.

<br />
<h2 class="h4">15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENERAL LEGAL TERMS</h2>
<p>15.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Terms, including all Order Forms, constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Pulumi and govern your use of the Pulumi Services (but excluding any services which Pulumi may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Pulumi in relation to the Pulumi Services.</p>
<p>15.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture.</p>

<p>15.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You agree that if Pulumi does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Pulumi has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Pulumi&rsquo;s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Pulumi.</p>
<p>15.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Terms, and your relationship with Pulumi under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

A party’s sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in breach of this paragraph shall be, at the non-assigning party’s election, termination of your use of the Pulumi Services upon written notice to the assigning party.</p></p>
