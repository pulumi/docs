If You, in Your reasonable and good faith judgment, determine that any submitted Deliverable does not satisfy the agreed-upon acceptance criteria as specified in the applicable SOW or as mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties for such Deliverable, You must so notify Us in writing within 10 business days after Our submission of the Deliverable, specifying the deficiencies in detail.

If the parties determine that a Deliverable’s functional requirements specified in a SOW or Order Form require modification (for example, due to incorrect assumptions or changed requirements), they will cooperate in good faith to execute a Change Order for such revised requirements.</p>

<p>4.3.    No Effect on Warranty Remedies. Acceptance of Professional Services, including a Deliverable, will not affect Your rights or remedies under the “Warranty” section below.</p>

<p>7.1.    Definition of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information of each party includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all SOWs or Order Forms (including pricing), as well as business and marketing plans, strategies, data, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by such party. However, Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party.</p>

Neither party will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any SOW or Order Form to any third party other than its Affiliates, legal counsel and accountants without the other party’s prior written consent, provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its Affiliate, legal counsel or accountants will remain responsible for such Affiliate’s, legal counsel’s or accountant’s compliance with this “Confidentiality” section.</p>

<p>7.3.    Compelled Disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.</p>

<h4 id="9-indemnification">9.    INDEMNIFICATION</h4>

<p>9.1.    Mutual Indemnity. Each party (the “Provider”) will defend the other party (the “Recipient”) against any Claim made or brought against the Recipient by a third party alleging that any information, design, specification, instruction, software, data or material furnished by the Provider hereunder (“Material”) infringes or misappropriates such third party’s intellectual property rights, and will indemnify the Recipient from any damages, attorney’s fees and costs finally awarded against the Recipient as a result of, or for amounts paid by Recipient under a settlement approved in writing by Provider of, any such Claim, provided that the Recipient: (a) promptly gives the Provider written notice of the Claim; (b) gives the Provider sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (except that the Provider may not settle any Claim unless it unconditionally releases the Recipient of  all liability); and &copy; gives the Provider  all reasonable assistance,  at  the Provider’s  cost.  The Provider will have no liability for any such Claim to the extent that (i) it arises from specifications or other Material provided by the other party, or (ii) such claim is based on the Recipient’s use of a superseded or altered version of Material if infringement or misappropriation would have been avoided by the use of a subsequent or unaltered version of the Material that was provided to the Recipient.  In the event that some or all of the Material is held or is reasonably believed by the Provider to infringe or misappropriate, the Provider may in its discretion and at no cost to the Recipient (A) modify or replace the Material so it is no longer claimed to infringe or misappropriate, (B) obtain a license for the Recipient’s continued use of the Material in accordance with this Agreement, or &copy; require return of the affected Material and all rights thereto from the Recipient.

<p>14.9.    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be deemed null and void, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect.</p>

<p>14.10.    Assignment. Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the other party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), provided however, either party may assign this Agreement in its entirety (including all SOWs or Order Forms, as applicable), without the other party’s consent, to its Affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a party is acquired by, sells substantially all of its assets to, or undergoes a change of control in favor of, a direct competitor of the other party, then such other party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice. A party’s sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in breach of this paragraph will be, at the non-assigning party’s election, termination of this Agreement upon written notice to the assigning party. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
