When using a managed stack, preview and update operations are performed by the Pulumi service. Managed stacks are more robust, as deployment history and current state are all managed for you. This makes it safe to run deployments in a team or continuous deployment workflow.

The Pulumi Console provides a web-based management experience for Pulumi. To access, visit [https://beta.pulumi.com](https://beta.pulumi.com).
