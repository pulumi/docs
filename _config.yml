# "Collections" is a Jekyll feature to create a grouping of similar datum or pages.
# https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/
#
# We use them throughout the site so we can easily render a table of contents for
# the specific collection, e.g. examples of using Pulumi with AWS.
#
# Note that using a "collection", requires that the folder name be prefixed with
# an underscore and also requires an explicit "output" setting to be rendered.
collections:
  # AWS-specific landing pages for using common resource types.
  aws:
    permalink: /:collection/:name/
