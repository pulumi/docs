NOTE: To update this page with a new binary release, do the following:
- Update `installer_version` in the YAML front matter above. 
- Update changelog.md with the latest fixes in the release
-->

To install Pulumi, run the following command from a terminal:

**On macOS or Linux**:

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
```

This will install the `pulumi` CLI to `~/.pulumi/bin` and add it to your path.

**On Windows** (in a cmd.exe shell):

```batch
@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://get.pulumi.com/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\.pulumi\bin"
```

This will install the `pulumi.exe` CLI to `%USERPROFILE%\.pulumi\bin` and add it to your path.

The installer script downloads and installs Pulumi, or upgrades to the latest version if you've already installed it.

## Cloud Configuration

After installation, you will want to configure Pulumi for your cloud provider:

* [AWS](./aws.html)
* [Azure](./azure.html)
* [GCP](./gcp.html)
* [Kubernetes](./kubernetes.html)

## Verifying the Installation

After installing, verify everything is in working order by running the `pulumi` CLI:

```bash
$ pulumi version
v{{page.installer_version}}
```

If you get an error that `pulumi` could not be found, it means your `PATH` environment variable has not been configured
correctly. Please go back and ensure your `PATH` contains the directory containing the `pulumi` CLI installed earlier.
