# Pulumi Change Log

## [0.9.11] - 2018/01/22

### Added

- Added the ability to import or export a stack's deployment in the Pulumi CLI. This command can be used for either local or managed stacks. There are two new verbs under the command `stack`:
   - `export` writes the current stack's latest deployment to stdout in JSON format.
   - `import` reads a new JSON deployment from stdin and applies it to the current stack.

- A basic progress spinner is displayed during deployment operations. 
   - When the Pulumi CLI is run in interactive mode, it displays an animated ASCII spinner
   - When run in non-interactive mode, CLI prints a message that it is still working. For CI systems that kill jobs when there is no CLI output (such as TravisCI), this eliminates the need to create shell scripts that periodically print output. 

- [@pulumi/cloud] Support for ACM certificates on HttpEndpoint. The AWS implementation of `HttpEndpoint#attachCustomDomain` accepts an ACM cert in place of raw certificate material, making it much easier to use `HttpEndpoint` with custom domains.

- [@pulumi/cloud] Added `HttpEndpoint#proxy` function to provide routes on an HTTP endpoint which redirect to a URL or `cloud.Endpoint`.

- [@pulumi/cloud] Added `Response#getHeader` function.

- [@pulumi/cloud-aws] Many new config settings have been added to enable overriding defaults for Network and Cluster configuration - both for auto clusters and for externally provided networks and clusters.

### Changed

- To make the behavior of local and managed stacks consistent, the Pulumi CLI uses a separate encryption key for each stack, rather than one shared for all stacks. You can now use a different passphrase for different stacks. Similar to managed stacks, you cannot copy and paste an encrypted value from one stack to another in `Pulumi.yaml`. Instead you must manage the value via `pulumi config`.

- The default behavior for `--color` is now `always`. To change this, specify `--color always` or `--color never`. Previously, the value was based on the presence of the flag `--debug`.

- The command `pulumi logs` now defaults to returning one hour of logs and outputs the start time that is  used.

- [pulumi-aws] Auto-name ElasticSearch domain name, following the naming restrictions documented in [Amazon Elasticsearch documentation for DomainName](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-configuration-api.html#es-configuration-api-datatypes-domainname).

- [pulumi-cloud] Header names are now normalized (using toLowerCase) for HttpEndpoint.

- [pulumi-cloud] For `cloud.Service`, the default permissions for cluster EC2 instances have been reduced.

- [pulumi-cloud] Pulumi now adds a `Name` tag onto instances launched into the ECS cluster.

- [pulumi-cloud] Expose additional AWS resources in `@pulumi/cloud-aws`: Topic, Timer, Table and HttpEndpoint.

### Fixed

- When a stack is removed, `pulumi` now deletes any configuration it had saved in either the `Pulumi.yaml` file or the workspace.

## 0.9.8 

### Added 

#### Pulumi Console and managed stacks

New in this release is the [Pulumi Console](https://beta.pulumi.com) and stacks that are managed by Pulumi. This is the recommended way to safely deploy cloud applications.
- `pulumi stack init` now creates a Pulumi managed stack. For a local stack, use `--local`. To learn more, see the tutorial [Create and work with managed stacks](../how-to/cloud-stack.html). 
- All Pulumi CLI commands now work with managed stacks. Login to Pulumi via `pulumi login`.
- The [Pulumi Console](https://beta.pulumi.com) provides a management experience for stacks. You can view the currently deployed resources (along with the AWS ARNs) and see logs from the last update operation.
For more information, see the documentation articles [Using the Pulumi Console](../how-to/console.html) and [Use Travis to continuously deploy Pulumi programs](../how-to/cicd-with-travis.html).

#### Components and output properties

-  Support for component resources([pulumi #340](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/340)), enabling grouping of resources into logical components. This provides an improved view of resources during `preview` and `update` operations in the CLI ([pulumi #417](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/417)).
  
  ```
  + pulumi:pulumi:Stack: (create)
     [urn=urn:pulumi:donna-testing::url-shortener::pulumi:pulumi:Stack::url-shortener-donna-testing]
     + cloud:table:Table: (create)
        [urn=urn:pulumi:donna-testing::url-shortener::cloud:table:Table::urls]
        + aws:dynamodb/table:Table: (create)
              [urn=urn:pulumi:donna-testing::url-shortener::cloud:table:Table$aws:dynamodb/table:Table::urls]
  ```
- A stack can have *output properties*, defined as `export let varName = val`. You can view the last deployed value for the output property using `pulumi stack output varName` or in the Pulumi Console.

#### Resource naming

Resource naming is now more consistent, but there is a new file format for checkpoint files for both local and managed stacks. 

> If you created stacks in the 0.8 release, you should destroy them with the 0.8 CLI, then recreate with the 0.9.x CLI.

#### Support for configuration secrets
- Store secrets securely in configuration via `pulumi config set --secret`. chris
- The verbs for `config` are now consistent, via `get`, `set`, and `rm`. See [Consistent config verbs #552](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/552).

#### Logging

- [**experimental**] Support for the `pulumi logs` command ([pulumi #527](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/527)). Unified logging is available in all of the `@pulumi/cloud` components ([pulumi-cloud #40](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-cloud/issues/40)). These features now work:
   - To see new logs as they arrive, use `--follow`
   - Use `--since` to limit to recent logs, such as `pulumi logs --since=1h`
   - Filter to specific resources with `--resource`. This filters to a particular component and its child resources (if any), such as `pulumi logs --resource examples-todoc57917fa --since 1h`

#### Other features

- Support for `.pulumiignore`, for files that should not be uploaded when deploying a managed stack through Pulumi. [pulumi-service \#122](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-service/issues/122)
- [Allow overriding a `Pulumi.yaml`'s entrypoint #575](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/575). To specify the entry directory, specify `main` in `Pulumi.yaml`. For instance, `main: a/path/to/main/`.
- Support for *protected* resources. A resource can be marked as `protect: true`, which prevents deletion of the resource. For example, `let res = new MyResource("precious", { .. }, { protect: true });`. To "unprotect" the resource, change `protect: false` then run `pulumi update`. See [Allow resources to be flagged "protected" #689](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/689).
- Changed defaults for workspace and stack configuration. See [Workspace configuration is error prone #714](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/714).
- Allow configuring the number of availability zones in auto-cluster via the setting `cloud-aws:config:ecsAutoClusterNumberOfAZs`. See [Provide config for auto-cluster's number of availability zones #300](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-cloud/issues/300).
- [Save configuration under the stack by default](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/693).
- [Create an endpoint for downloading the Pulumi SDK via beta.pulumi.com #372](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-service/issues/372).

### Fixed
- Improved SDK installer. It automatically creates directories as needed, configures node modules, and prints out friendly error messages.
