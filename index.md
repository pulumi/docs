**Pulumi is the easiest way to build, connect, and run modern cloud applications.**

**Bring Your Own Language.**  Pulumi lets you write portable Cloud Applications in your a regular programming  language, using your favorite IDEs and tools, and runs them on the cloud of your choice.  The result is a truly
cloud native application.

**The Modern Cloud, Now Easy to Use.**  Pulumi delivers the latest innovations in cloud computing to your fingertips,
letting you focus on code, instead of infrastructure, operations, and configuration.  No more strange markup and
templating DSLs to learn and maintain.  You just write familiar and lovable code, and Pulumi takes care of the rest.

**Infinite Scale at the Best Possible Cost.**  Pulumi's unique approach to building Cloud Applications means that you
are ready to scale to meet demand by default, without any added complexity.  By leveraging serverless computing and
containers, you only pay for what you use, rather than provisioning and parking expensive and needless VMs.
