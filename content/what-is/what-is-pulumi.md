---

The modern cloud landscape has transformed how organizations build and deploy applications, but managing cloud infrastructure often remains a complex, error-prone process involving clicking through web consoles, writing brittle scripts, or learning domain-specific languages. Pulumi emerges as a solution that fundamentally changes this paradigm by enabling developers and infrastructure teams to manage cloud resources using the same programming languages they already know and love.

Pulumi is a cloud engineering platform that treats infrastructure as software, allowing teams to define, deploy, and manage cloud resources using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, Java, and YAML. Rather than forcing teams to learn proprietary configuration languages or rely on limited templating systems, Pulumi brings the full power of modern software development practices to infrastructure management.

## The evolution of infrastructure management

To understand Pulumi's significance, it's helpful to consider how infrastructure management has evolved. In the early days of cloud computing, infrastructure was typically managed through web consoles or command-line interfaces. While functional, this approach suffered from poor repeatability, limited collaboration capabilities, and difficulty tracking changes over time.

The introduction of infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation represented a significant improvement, enabling teams to define infrastructure declaratively and version control their configurations. However, these tools introduced their own challenges through domain-specific languages that required additional learning curves and offered limited expressiveness compared to general-purpose programming languages.

Pulumi represents the next evolution in this space by embracing what the company calls "infrastructure as software." This approach enables teams to leverage the full software engineering ecosystem—including testing frameworks, package managers, IDEs, and development workflows—when managing their cloud infrastructure.

## Pulumi in the AI coding era

The emergence of AI-powered code generation tools is fundamentally transforming how software is developed. More code is being written faster than ever before, with AI assistants generating complex applications and infrastructure configurations at unprecedented speeds. However, this shift brings both opportunities and challenges that make platforms like Pulumi more essential, not less.

While AI can accelerate code creation, it doesn't eliminate the need for governance, security, and operational best practices. In fact, as teams generate more code with potentially less deep understanding of every component, the importance of having robust infrastructure management practices becomes even more critical. Code still needs to run securely, cost-effectively, and in compliance with organizational policies regardless of how it was created.

Pulumi serves as the essential building block for this AI-driven future—functioning as "Git for your cloud infrastructure." Just as version control systems became indispensable as software development scaled, infrastructure as code platforms have become crucial as AI accelerates both application and infrastructure development. The platform provides the governance layer that ensures AI-generated infrastructure follows organizational standards, security requirements, and cost controls.

The combination of AI coding tools with Pulumi's platform capabilities, particularly through Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), enables organizations to marry the speed and creativity of AI-assisted development with the reliability and governance required for production cloud environments. This approach prevents AI from becoming the new "ClickOps"—where rapid changes bypass proper controls and oversight.

## How Pulumi works

At its core, Pulumi follows a declarative model where you describe your desired infrastructure state in code, and the platform handles the complexities of provisioning, updating, and managing cloud resources to achieve that state. This process involves several key components working together seamlessly.

The Pulumi SDK provides language-specific libraries that offer strongly-typed bindings for cloud resources across 150+ providers. These libraries enable developers to define infrastructure using familiar programming constructs like functions, loops, conditionals, and classes, while providing rich IDE support including IntelliSense, error checking, and refactoring capabilities.

When you run a [Pulumi program](/docs/iac/concepts/projects/), the deployment engine analyzes your code, computes the necessary changes to reach your desired state, and executes those changes in the optimal order while respecting resource dependencies. The engine maintains a detailed record of your infrastructure state, enabling features like drift detection, rollback capabilities, and collaborative workflows.

The [Pulumi CLI](/docs/iac/cli/) serves as the primary interface for managing deployments, providing commands for previewing changes, executing deployments, and managing the infrastructure lifecycle. For teams requiring additional collaboration and governance features, Pulumi Cloud offers a managed service that provides centralized state management, team collaboration tools, policy enforcement, and detailed audit trails.

## Key concepts and architecture

Understanding Pulumi's architecture requires familiarity with several foundational concepts that distinguish it from traditional infrastructure tools.

**[Projects](/docs/iac/concepts/projects/) and [stacks](/docs/iac/concepts/stacks/)** form the organizational backbone of Pulumi's approach. A project represents a directory containing your infrastructure code and metadata, while stacks provide isolated instances of your project for different environments like development, staging, and production. This separation enables teams to manage multiple environments from a single codebase while maintaining appropriate isolation and configuration differences.

**[Resources](/docs/iac/concepts/resources/)** represent the fundamental building blocks of your infrastructure, from individual cloud services like AWS S3 buckets to complex, multi-resource constructs like entire application architectures. Pulumi's resource model supports both primitive resources that map directly to cloud provider APIs and component resources that encapsulate multiple resources into reusable abstractions.

**Configuration and secrets management** is handled through an advanced system that provides stack-specific configuration values while ensuring sensitive information remains encrypted. Pulumi ESC (Environments, Secrets, and Configuration) extends this capability by providing centralized secrets management across environments and applications, integrating with existing secret stores and identity providers.

The **state management** system maintains a comprehensive record of your infrastructure's current state, enabling Pulumi to compute the minimal set of changes needed for any deployment. Unlike some tools that store state in plain text, Pulumi encrypts sensitive information by default and provides robust state management capabilities through both local and cloud-based backends.

## The Pulumi Registry: A comprehensive ecosystem

The [Pulumi Registry](/registry/) represents one of Pulumi's most significant advantages over traditional infrastructure tools. This comprehensive ecosystem provides access to over 150 cloud and SaaS providers through a unified, multi-language interface that goes far beyond what any single cloud provider offers.

### Native cloud providers

Pulumi maintains native, first-party providers for major cloud platforms that offer same-day support for new services and features. The AWS provider covers over 900 resources, while Azure Native provides access to the full Azure API surface area, and Google Cloud offers comprehensive coverage of GCP services. These native providers are generated directly from cloud provider APIs, ensuring immediate access to new features without waiting for community contributions or manual updates.

### Beyond traditional clouds

The registry extends far beyond traditional cloud providers to include specialized services that modern applications depend on. Teams can manage Datadog monitoring, Auth0 identity, GitHub repositories, Cloudflare edge services, and dozens of other SaaS platforms using the same patterns and languages they use for their core infrastructure.

### Community and official packages

The registry combines official packages maintained by Pulumi with a growing ecosystem of community contributions. Popular packages include Kubernetes operators, Docker configurations, and specialized industry solutions. Each package is automatically generated for all supported programming languages, meaning a single package definition provides TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, and Java bindings.

### Crosswalk collections

Pulumi Crosswalk collections represent opinionated, well-architected patterns for common cloud scenarios. These collections encapsulate cloud provider best practices into higher-level abstractions, enabling teams to deploy production-ready architectures with minimal code. For example, Crosswalk for AWS provides secure, scalable patterns for containers, serverless applications, and data processing pipelines.

## The power of real programming languages

One of Pulumi's most significant differentiators is its support for general-purpose programming languages rather than domain-specific languages. This design choice has profound implications for how teams approach infrastructure management.

Using familiar programming languages means developers can apply existing skills and knowledge to infrastructure problems. They can leverage the full ecosystem of language features, including package managers, testing frameworks, and development tools. This approach eliminates the need to learn proprietary configuration languages and enables teams to create more sophisticated, maintainable infrastructure code.

The ability to use standard programming constructs like loops, conditionals, and functions enables dynamic infrastructure definitions that would be difficult or impossible with templating-based approaches. For example, you might programmatically create resources based on environment variables, implement complex business logic within your infrastructure code, or generate resources based on external data sources.

Furthermore, Pulumi's language support extends beyond basic resource definitions to include comprehensive [testing capabilities](/docs/iac/concepts/testing/). Teams can write unit tests for their infrastructure code, validate resource configurations before deployment, and implement integration tests to ensure their infrastructure behaves correctly in different scenarios.

## Advanced platform capabilities

Pulumi goes beyond basic infrastructure provisioning to provide a comprehensive platform for modern cloud engineering.

### Automation API

The Automation API enables teams to embed infrastructure management directly into their applications, creating custom deployment tools, self-service portals, and dynamic infrastructure provisioning systems. This programmatic approach enables organizations to build advanced infrastructure automation that integrates seamlessly with their development workflows, particularly valuable when dealing with AI-generated code that requires automated deployment pipelines.

### Policy as Code with CrossGuard

CrossGuard provides policy as code capabilities that are both open source and free, unlike competitive offerings. Teams can write policies in Python, JavaScript, or Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego to enforce security, compliance, and cost controls across their entire infrastructure. These policies run server-side and can provide automated remediation, ensuring that all infrastructure deployments—whether created by humans or AI—meet organizational standards.

### Pulumi ESC for secrets and configuration

Pulumi ESC addresses one of the most critical challenges in modern cloud operations: secrets and configuration management. This service provides centralized, auditable secrets management that can pull from multiple secret stores, generate dynamic short-lived credentials via OIDC, and compose configurations across environments. ESC can be used with or without Pulumi IaC, making it valuable for any cloud application.

### AI-powered development assistance
