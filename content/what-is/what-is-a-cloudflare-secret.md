[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) operates one of the world's largest networks, providing network and cloud services to improve website and application security and performance. A critical security aspect of building applications and solutions integrating with Cloudflare involves the management of sensitive data, commonly known as [secrets](/what-is/what-is-secrets-management/). Cloudflare has a secure mechanism for handling secrets, offering tools for storing, accessing, and managing confidential information in the cloud.

## What is a Cloudflare secret?

Cloudflare secrets are sensitive information stored as encrypted environment variables for [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) (execution environments for serverless applications). Secrets include but are not limited to database credentials, API keys, and other confidential data. There is no need to hard-code sensitive information in plain text.

### Key features

- **Secure and encrypted storage**: Secrets in Cloudflare are encrypted during transit and at rest, ensuring high security.
- **Native application integration:** Cloudflare secrets integrate directly with Cloudflare Workers, eliminating the need for complex setup. This built-in solution provides automatic retrieval and management of credentials.
- **Environment variable flexibility:** Cloudflare secrets are easily referenced as environment variables across Workers.

## Creating Cloudflare secrets via the CLI

You can create secrets via [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), the Cloudflare Workers CLI.

### Prerequisites

- Install [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
- Sign up for a free [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/)
- Create a new project and navigate to it's directory:

    ```bash
    $ npx wrangler init secrets-demo
    # Select "Hello World" Worker
    # Confirm "Yes" to using Typescript
    # Confirm "Yes" to using using Git
    # Select "No" to deploy the application

    $ cd secrets-demo
    ```

- Login to your Cloudflare account and authorize Wrangler:

    ```bash
    $ npx wrangler login  
    # Confirm authorization to Wrangler
    ```

### Create a secret

You can create a secret by running the command:

```bash
$ npx wrangler secret put MY_SECRET_NAME_KEY
```

Next, you will be prompted to input the secret‚Äôs value, type:

```bash
 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 3.19.0
-------------------
? Enter a secret value: ‚Ä∫ dragons and unicorns are real
```

Press Enter to save the secret. You'll see output similar to the following:

```bash
‚úî Enter a secret value: ‚Ä¶ *****************************
üåÄ Creating the secret for the Worker "secrets-demo"
‚ú® Success! Uploaded secret MY_SECRET_NAME_KEY
```

Verify the secret was created:

```bash
$ npx wrangler secret list
[
  {
    "name": "MY_SECRET_NAME_KEY",
    "type": "secret_text"
  }
]
```

### Accessing the secret from a Cloudflare Worker

Now that you have created a secret, your application can access it by referencing it in the Worker code.

For example, in TypeScript you might use code that looks something like this to retrieve and return the value of the Cloudflare secret:

```typescript
export default {
        async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
                return new Response(`Secret: ${env.MY_SECRET_NAME_KEY}`);
        },
};
```

Deploy the changes.

```bash
$ npx wrangler deploy
 ‚õÖÔ∏è wrangler 3.19.0
-------------------
Total Upload: 0.21 KiB / gzip: 0.18 KiB
Uploaded secrets-demo (0.92 sec)
Published secrets-demo (3.61 sec)
  https://secrets-demo.diana-247.workers.dev
Current Deployment ID: e7c2b8e7-e13a-4a11-9667-024eed3cce05
```

Here's an example of using `curl` against a Cloudflare Worker serverless application using the code above to retrieve and return a Cloudflare secret value:

```bash
$ curl https://secrets-demo.diana-247.workers.dev

Secret: dragons and unicorns are real
```

## Best practices

- **Rotate secrets regularly**: Implement a routine for periodically rotating secrets to enhance security.
- **Provide least-privilege access**: Employ policies for granular access control to secrets.
- **Audit and monitor secret access**: Use monitoring tools to track access and modifications to your secrets.

### Challenges and considerations

Using Cloudflare secrets comes with particular challenges and considerations:

- **Management of secrets overhead:**  As the number of secrets and contexts grows, managing them can become challenging. Teams must actively track and monitor the usage of secrets, identifying where and by whom they are employed.
- **Access control complexity:** Setting up fine-grained access controls is crucial but can become complex as teams and projects scale. Defining and maintaining access permissions for different roles and responsibilities can be challenging. Clearly define roles and duties to determine who needs access to specific secrets. Use role-based access control (RBAC) principles to simplify and organize permissions.
- **Integration with external secret management systems:**  Organizations may already have established processes for secrets management using external tools, and integrating these with Cloudflare secrets can be complex. Evaluate whether integrating with an external secrets management system is necessary for your organization. If required, explore solutions that integrate with Cloudflare and provide a unified approach to secrets management. Ensure that the chosen solution aligns with your security and compliance requirements. Two popular secret management systems include [AWS Secrets Manager](/what-is/what-is-aws-secrets-manager/) and [Google Cloud Secret Manager](/what-is/what-is-google-cloud-secret-manager/).

Addressing these challenges and considerations requires a thoughtful approach to [secrets management](
/what-is/what-is-secrets-management/), clear communication within the development team, and a commitment to maintaining security best practices. A beta product to facilitate secrets management and tackle the above challenges is available for Cloudflare as the [Cloudflare Secrets Store](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secrets-store/).

## Conclusion  

Following security best practices for Cloudflare secrets are crucial in managing sensitive information in your solutions, applications, and cloud environments.
