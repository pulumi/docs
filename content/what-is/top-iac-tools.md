Infrastructure as Code tools (IaC tools) let you automate the setup of your cloud resources, without manually clicking around in your cloud web console. Instead of manually configuring resources, you write a script that specifies what you need, and the cloud provider sets it up for you. It's a great way to make infrastructure setup consistent, and repeatable.

But which tool should you use choose? We obviously have our own preferences and biases ðŸ˜‰ but let's go through the most popular, and some ess popular IaC tools to give you a lay of the land.

We'll assess each tool based on the following criteria:

| Criteria    | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flexibility | Ability to abstract and create reusable components                          |
| Multicloud  | Capability to manage resources across various cloud providers               |
| State       | How the tool handles state tracking and management                          |
| Integration | Compatibility with existing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines       |
| Ecosystem   | Community strength, documentation quality, and support resources            |

We'll be covering modern multi-cloud tools, vendor and cloud specific solutions, and some less common options.

## Modern Multi-Cloud Infrastructure as Code Tools

First up to consider are IaC tools that manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers. If you don't have any unusual requirements or legacy investments you should be picking one of these.

## Pulumi

This is the Pulumi website, so its obvisouly not an unbaised source of information but Pulumi stands out as a versatile Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, offering the flexibility to manage infrastructure using a variety of programming languages.

This flexibility allows developers to define infrastructure with real programming constructs, such as loops and functions, which simplifies handling complex logic compared to purely declarative languages like HCL.

## OpenTofu

OpenTofu shares many similarities with Terraform, as it is a fork of Terraform 1.6.x. Both tools enable the creation, deployment, and management of infrastructure as code across various cloud platforms using the HCL.

One of the key differences between OpenTofu and Terraform is their licensing model. OpenTofu is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0, whereas Terraform uses the Business Source License model. As OpenTofu continues to evolve, more differences are [expected to emerge](/docs/iac/concepts/vs/terraform/opentofu/).

## Cloud-Specific IaC Tools

While multi-cloud tools offer flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, many organizations still opt for cloud-specific IaC tools.

These native solutions may provide deeper integration with their respective cloud platforms. However,  Multi-cloud solutions offer several strategic advantages over vendor specific tools. By preventing vendor lock-in, organizations maintain flexibility and negotiating power, avoiding over-reliance on a single provider. They also promotes skill portability. Learn one tool and become capable of managing diverse cloud infrastructures. Never the less, its important to review this category of tools.

Let's explore some of the most prominent cloud-specific IaC tools and how they compare to their multi-cloud counterparts in terms of flexibility, integration, and ecosystem support.

## AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation supports JSON or YAML. Like Pulumi and Terraform it has a declarative, desired state approach.

CloudFormation is supported by extensive documentation. However, managing complex templates can be challenging, and there is a steep learning curve associated with CloudFormation's syntax and AWS services. Performance issues may arise with large deployments, but rollback triggers are available to revert to a previous state if a deployment fails.

CloudFormation supports cross-account and cross-region deployments. Despite its strengths, CloudFormation has limitations, such as template size restrictions and cryptic error messages that complicate error handling. Managing dependencies between resources can be complex, and the tool lacks built-in testing capabilities for templates.

- **Flexibility**: Some support for abstraction and modularity through nested stacks and reusable templates. Not as flexible or powerful as Terraform's HCL modules or Pulumi's use of programming languages for defining infrastructure.
- **Integration**: Integrates well with AWS-native CI/CD. Broader integration to non-AWS environments is more challenging.
- **Ecosystem**: Supported by a documentation, providing resources for learning and troubleshooting.

## Azure Resource Manager Evaluation

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) supports JSON-based configuration or the use of Bicep - a ARM specific DSL. JSON based templating is also possible. ARM integrates deeply with Azure services including Azure DevOps, however, integration with non-Azure workflows can be a challenge. The ecosystem is supported by a large community and extensive documentation. The complexity of managing dependencies between resources, with ARM, can increase with scale. Potential performance issues with large deployments have been a challenge with ARM. As well, as limited support for testing changes. Azure Resource Manager is prefered by those who want a native Azure tool.

- **Integration**: Integrates deeply with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. Additional features for integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Ecosystem**: Supported by documentation, and a smaller GCP focused community.

## Historical and Interesting IaC Tools

All the tools covered so far track the current state of infrastructure and compare it to a declariative desired end state.  The stored state can be stored locally or in a remote backend. During operations, the tool compares the desired state (code) with the current state (state file), plans necessary changes, and executes them to align the actual infrastructure with the desired state. Tools in this section often take a different approach.

Tools that have significantly influenced IaC evolution and offer unique capabilities.

- Ansible: An agentless tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
- Chef: Automates infrastructure configuration, deployment, and management using code.
