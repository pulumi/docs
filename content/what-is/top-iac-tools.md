Infrastructure as Code tools (IaC tools) let you automate the setup of your cloud resources, without manually clicking around in your cloud web console. Instead of manually configuring resources, you write a script that specifies what you need, and the cloud provider sets it up for you. It's a great way to make infrastructure setup consistent, and repeatable.

But which tool should you use choose? We obviously have our own preferences and biases ðŸ˜‰ but let's go through the most popular, and some ess popular IaC tools to give you a lay of the land.

We'll be covering modern multi-cloud tools, vendor and cloud specific solutions, and some less common options. To effectively judge each tool, we consider their ability to flexibly abstract and manage infrastructure configurations and to support multi-cloud environments. Additionally, we assess how each tool handles state tracking and management, its compatibility with existing development workflows, and the strength and activity of its community, ecosystem and documentation.

## Modern Multi-Cloud Infrastructure as Code Tools

First up to consider are IaC tools that manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers. If you don't have any unusual requirements or legacy investments you should be picking one of these.

## Pulumi

This is the Pulumi website, so its obvisouly not an unbaised source of information but Pulumi stands out as a versatile Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, offering the flexibility to manage infrastructure using a variety of programming languages.

This flexibility allows developers to define infrastructure with real programming constructs, such as loops and functions, which simplifies handling complex logic compared to purely declarative languages like HCL. Pulumi excels in multi-cloud support, seamlessly integrating with major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and many others. This integration is facilitated by its use of familiar programming languages, enhancing productivity and collaboration within development workflows.

Pulumi's state management is easier to use than many solutions, automatically handling infrastructure state and storing it in the Pulumi Service by default. This approach simplifies collaboration and reduces the risk of state corruption, with built-in state locking and encryption ensuring secure and consistent state management. For those who prefer more control, Pulumi also supports self-managed backends.

Pulumi integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows, allowing developers to use familiar tools and practices, which enhances productivity and collaboration. Pulumi's ecosystem is growing rapidly, second only to Terraform, with a wide range of resources and integrations available. Comprehensive documentation and support, including tutorials and an active community forum, further bolster its appeal.

## OpenTofu

OpenTofu shares many similarities with Terraform, as it is a fork of Terraform 1.6.x. Both tools enable the creation, deployment, and management of infrastructure as code across various cloud platforms using the HCL.

One of the key differences between OpenTofu and Terraform is their licensing model. OpenTofu is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0, whereas Terraform uses the Business Source License model. As OpenTofu continues to evolve, more differences are [expected to emerge](/docs/iac/concepts/vs/terraform/opentofu/).

## Cloud-Specific IaC Tools

The next type of Iac Tool, in terms of popularity is the cloud or vendor specific tool. These tools are popular amoung those who prefer a native tool.

Multi-cloud solutions offer several strategic advantages over vendor specific tools. By preventing vendor lock-in, organizations maintain flexibility and negotiating power, avoiding over-reliance on a single provider. They also promotes skill portability, creating a versatile workforce capable of managing diverse cloud infrastructures. Never the less, its important to review this category of tools.

For cloud-specific IaC tools, we focus on Flexibility, Integration, and Ecosystem. We omit multi-cloud support and State management. In all these tools, State management is handled internally by the cloud provider, using a desired state model.

## AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation supports JSON or YAML. Like Pulumi and Terraform it has a declarative, desired state approach.

CloudFormation is supported by extensive documentation. However, managing complex templates can be challenging, and there is a steep learning curve associated with CloudFormation's syntax and AWS services. Performance issues may arise with large deployments, but rollback triggers are available to revert to a previous state if a deployment fails.

CloudFormation supports cross-account and cross-region deployments. Despite its strengths, CloudFormation has limitations, such as template size restrictions and cryptic error messages that complicate error handling. Managing dependencies between resources can be complex, and the tool lacks built-in testing capabilities for templates.

- **Flexibility**: Some support for abstraction and modularity through nested stacks and reusable templates. Not as flexible or powerful as Terraform's HCL modules or Pulumi's use of programming languages for defining infrastructure.
- **Integration**: Integrates well with AWS-native CI/CD. Broader integration to non-AWS environments is more challenging.
- **Ecosystem**: Supported by a documentation, providing resources for learning and troubleshooting.
