Infrastructure as Code tools (IaC tools) let you automate the setup of your cloud resources without manually clicking around in your cloud web console. Instead of manually configuring resources, you write a script that specifies what you need, and the cloud provider sets it up for you. It's a great way to make infrastructure setup consistent and repeatable.

But which tool should you use choose? We have our preferences and biases ðŸ˜‰ but let's go through the most popular and some less popular IaC tools to give you a lay of the land.

We'll assess each tool based on the following criteria:

| Criteria    | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flexibility | Ability to abstract and create reusable components                          |
| Multi-cloud  | Capability to manage resources across various cloud providers               |
| State       | How the tool handles state tracking and management                          |
| Integration | Compatibility with existing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines       |
| Ecosystem   | Community strength, documentation quality, and support resources            |

We'll cover modern multi-cloud tools, vendor and cloud-specific solutions, and some less common options.

## Multi-Cloud Infrastructure as Code Tools

First up, IaC tools that manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers. You should pick one of these if you don't have any unusual requirements or legacy investments.

### Terraform

Terraform is a multi-cloud Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that utilizes the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). HCL is designed to be both human-readable and machine-friendly, striking a balance between simplicity and power. While it lacks some of the advanced programming constructs of general-purpose languages, HCL offers a declarative approach that many find intuitive for infrastructure definition. HCL lacks full programming constructs, which may necessitate workarounds for handling complex logic.

For state management, Terraform uses a state file to track the current state of your infrastructure. While this approach requires manual configuration, including setting up remote backends and state locking, it does offer fine-grained control over state.

Terraform integrates well with existing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines, although additional scripting may be needed for complex scenarios. Terraform also has a wide range of plugins, integrations, and comprehensive documentation.

- **Flexibility**: Utilizes HCL. Lacks full programming constructs.
- **Multi-cloud**: Offers support for AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle cloud and many others.
- **State**: Requires manual configuration for state management, including remote backends and state locking, which can add complexity to collaboration.
- **Integration**: Integrates well with existing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines, though additional scripting may be needed for complex scenarios.
- **Ecosystem**: A large and active community. A wide range of plugins and integrations.

### OpenTofu

OpenTofu is a recent fork of Terraform 1.6.x. It shares many core functionalities with Terraform, including using HCL to define infrastructure.

While OpenTofu aims to maintain compatibility with Terraform, it's expected to develop its own unique features and community-driven improvements over time. The primary difference currently lies in the licensing model, with OpenTofu using the Mozilla Public License 2.0.

For a more detailed comparison between OpenTofu and other IaC tools, including Terraform and Pulumi, please refer to our in-depth article: [Terraform vs.OpenTofu](/docs/iac/concepts/vs/terraform/opentofu/).

- **Multi-cloud**: Supports multiple cloud providers, mirroring Terraform's broad compatibility.
- **State**: Employs a state file system similar to Terraform for tracking infrastructure.
- **Integration**: Compatible with existing Terraform workflows and integrations.
- **Ecosystem**: Building its community and ecosystem, leveraging its Terraform roots.

## Cloud-Specific IaC Tools

While multi-cloud tools offer flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, many organizations still opt for cloud-specific IaC tools.

Cloud-specific tools can offer:

1. Potentially tighter integration with native services
2. Potentially simpler setup for teams already familiar with a particular cloud ecosystem
3. Access to platform-specific features that might not be available in multi-cloud tools

However, it's important to note that multi-cloud solutions offer more strategic advantages. They prevent vendor lock-in, maintain flexibility, and promote skill portability across different cloud environments. Despite these benefits of multi-cloud tools, understanding cloud-specific options is crucial for a comprehensive view of the IaC tooling landscape.

Let's explore some of the most prominent cloud-specific IaC tools and how they compare to their multi-cloud counterparts in terms of flexibility, integration, and ecosystem support.

### AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation supports JSON or YAML. Like Pulumi and Terraform, it has a declarative, desired state approach.

CloudFormation is supported by extensive documentation. However, managing complex templates can be challenging, and there is a steep learning curve associated with CloudFormation's syntax and AWS services. Performance issues may arise with large deployments, but rollback triggers can revert to a previous state if a deployment fails.

CloudFormation supports cross-account and cross-region deployments. Despite these strengths, CloudFormation has limitations. Template size limitations and cryptic error messages complicating error handling are among the most common online complaints. Managing dependencies between resources can become complex past a certain scale, and testing capabilities for templates are limited.

- **Flexibility**: Some support for abstraction and modularity through nested stacks and reusable templates.
- **Integration**: Integrates well with AWS-native CI/CD. Broader integration to non-AWS environments is possible but more challenging.
- **Ecosystem**: Supported by documentation, providing resources for learning and troubleshooting.

### Azure Resource Manager

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) supports JSON-based configuration or using Bicep - a ARM-specific DSL. JSON-based templating is also possible. ARM integrates deeply with Azure services including Azure DevOps, however, integration with non-Azure workflows can be more challenging. The ecosystem is supported by a large community and extensive documentation. The complexity of managing dependencies between resources with ARM can increase with scale. Potential performance issues with large deployments have been a challenge with ARM. However, Azure Resource Manager is preferred by those who want a native Azure tool and are deeply invested in the Azure ecosystem.
