Kubernetes, or K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## What are Kubernetes Secrets?

Kubernetes Secrets, or [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) for short, are a built-in Kubernetes solution to manage the lifecycle of secrets, which are sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and tokens. These secrets are consumed by containerized applications directly, to prevent the exposure of sensitive data in code, Docker images, or configuration files.

## Why use Kubernetes Secrets?

Manual secrets management is prone to introducing errors and poses high-lift operational challenges. At the same time,  the absence of a dedicated secret management solution means carrying a higher risk of accidental data leaks or unauthorized access to private information. One should never use ConfigMaps to hold secrets. Kubernetes Secrets come into play by providing an integrated mechanism for the secure storage and distribution of sensitive data to pods.

Kubernetes Secrets are fundamental to the cloud-native stack. It provides a secure and standardized means to manage sensitive information like credentials, tokens, or API keys within our cloud apps so these don't have to be passed around in plain text.

### Key features

Securing sensitive data in Kubernetes Secrets is essential for various reasons:

- **Managed lifecycle:** Secrets can be created, updated, and removed without restarting containers, ensuring seamless management.
- **Easy integration:** Applications can access secrets as environment variables or mounted files.
- **Dynamic updates:** Secrets can be updated without redeploying your applications.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC):** You can control who can access and modify secrets.
- **Enable auditing** When required for compliance.

## Kubernetes Secrets best practices

- **Use Namespacing:** Organize your secrets within namespaces to control access and limit exposure.
- **[Encrypt Sensitive Data](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/):** Ensure that secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit. Secret resources stored within etcd need to be encrypted at rest as this is not the default.
- **[Implement Access Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/):** Leverage Kubernetes RBAC to restrict access to secrets.
- **Regularly Rotate Secrets:** Periodically update your secrets to enhance security.

## Using Kubernetes Secrets

One crucial aspect of securing applications is managing sensitive data. We will delve into the use of Kubernetes Secrets by following the lifecycle of database credentials. In particular, you'll learn how to perform the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations against a Secret.

### Prerequisites

To use Kubernetes Secrets, a Kubernetes Cluster, and the [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) CLI are required.

Consider using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) as a starting option to getting a local Kubernetes Cluster installed. Alternatively, you can use [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/kubernetes/) to deploy a Kubernetes Cluster in [Azure](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/kubernetes/how-to-guides/aks/), [GCP](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/kubernetes/how-to-guides/gke/), or [AWS](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/kubernetes/how-to-guides/eks/).

Let's look at a practical example of how to create, read, update, and delete a Kubernetes Secret via the `kubectl` CLI.

### Creating a Kubernetes Secret

1. Define a new secret resource called `shhhhhh` that contains a user and a password. These are saved in the `dbcreds.yaml` file.

    ```bash
    $ cat <<EOF > dbcreds.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
        name: shhhhhh
    type: Opaque
    data:
        username: cm9vdA==
        password: cm9vdA==
    EOF
    ```

    The keys in the `data` section are encoded in base64. Given this is a basic example, we use 'root' for the credentials. This can be confirmed by running `echo "cm9vdA==" | base64 -d` which outputs
  `root`

2. Apply the new resource definition:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl apply -f dbcreds.yaml
    ```

3. Verify the contents:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl describe secrets shhhhhh  
    ```

### Reading a Kubernetes Secret

1. Run the following `kubectl` command along with the name of the secret.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get secret shhhhhh
    # NAME      TYPE     DATA   AGE
    # shhhhhh   Opaque   2      2m
    ```

2. To read a specific value within the secret, use `jsonpath` to specify the key.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl get secret shhhhhh -o jsonpath="{.data.user}" | base64 -d
    # root
    $ kubectl get secret shhhhhh -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
    # root
    ```

    Recall that the values are stored as base64 thus we have to decode them to read the actual value. Hence the `base64 -d`.

### Updating a Kubernetes Secret

In this example, we update the password of our secret so that it's a tad harder and does not match the username.

1. Determine the base64 encoding of the new password.

    ```bash
    echo "r00t123" | base64
    # cjAwdDEyMwo=
    ```

2. Open the editor to modify the secret.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl edit secrets shhhhhh
    ```

3. Replace the `data.password` with the new base64-encoded value from Step 1.

4. View the changes.

    ```bash
    kubectl get secret shhhhhh -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
    # r00t123
    ```

### Deleting a Kubernetes Secret

1. Run the following `kubectl` command along with the name of the secret.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl delete secret shhhhhh
    # secret "shhhhhh" deleted
    ```

### A real-world example with database credentials

When managing database credentials, you can use Kubernetes Secrets to securely define, store, and deploy the necessary credentials to your pods. This ensures that your application has secure access to the database, without exposing the credentials in your codebase.

Let's explore a real-world example that demonstrates the use of Kubernetes Secrets management.

In the below example, we have MongoDB in the backend provisioned via helm. It was configured by mounting a secret volume containing user credential(s). We then create a pod that mounts the same secret to test the connection to the backend.

1. Define a new secret resource.

    ```bash
    $ cat <<EOF > demo-dbcreds.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
        name: demo-dbcreds
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
        mongodb-root-password: 'r00t'
        mongodb-passwords: ''
    EOF
    ```

2. Apply the new resource definition.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl apply -f demo-dbcreds.yaml  --namespace mongodb
    ```

3. Use the [MongoDB Bitnami helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/mongodb) to deploy MongoDB.

    ```bash
    $ helm install backend \
       --set auth.username=root,auth.database=admin,architecture=standalone,persistence.enabled=false,auth.existingSecret=demo-dbcreds \
       oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/mongodb --namespace mongodb
    ```

    Note: This deployment is for demo purposes only.
    In the command above, the parameter `auth.existingSecret` has a reference to the previously created Secret, `demo-dbcreds`.

4. Confirm the secrets reference in the MongoDB pod.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl describe pod backend-mongodb-776ff496b7-hmlrq --namespace mongodb
    # ...
    # other output not shown
   # Environment:
   #   BITNAMI_DEBUG:                    false
   #   MONGODB_EXTRA_USERNAMES:          root
   #   MONGODB_EXTRA_DATABASES:          admin
   #   MONGODB_EXTRA_PASSWORDS:          <set to the key 'mongodb-passwords' in secret 'demo-dbcreds'>  Optional: false
   #   MONGODB_ROOT_USER:                root
   #   MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD:            <set to the key 'mongodb-root-password' in secret 'demo-dbcreds'>  Optional: false
    # ...
    ```

5. Create a pod to test connectivity. Note this pod will have the `demo-dbcreds` secret mounted.

    ```bash
    $ cat <<EOF > mongo-conn-test.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
     name: mongo-conn-test
    spec:
     containers:
     - name: mongo-conn-test
       image: mongo:latest
       command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
       args:
         - |
           echo "Waiting for MongoDB to be ready..."
           until mongosh --host=backend-mongodb.mongodb.svc.cluster.local -u root -p \$(cat /mnt/secrets/mongodb-root-password) --authenticationDatabase admin --eval "db.stats()" > /dev/null 2>&1; do
             sleep 5
           done
           echo "Connected to MongoDB!"
       volumeMounts:
       - name: secret-volume
         mountPath: "/mnt/secrets"
     volumes:
     - name: secret-volume
       secret:
         secretName: demo-dbcreds
    EOF
    ```

    Update your host if using a different resource name or namespace. This example uses `backend-mongodb.mongodb.svc.cluster.local`.

6. Create the pod.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl apply -f mongo-conn-test.yaml   --namespace mongodb
    ```

7. Verify connectivity via the logs.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl logs mongo-conn-test --namespace mongodb
    # Waiting for MongoDB to be ready...
    # Connected to MongoDB!
    ```

8. Delete the test pod.

    ```bash
    $ kubectl delete pod mongo-conn-test  --namespace mongodb
    ```

### Challenges and considerations

While Kubernetes Secrets provide a way to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and tokens, there are some challenges and considerations associated with their use. Here are some common challenges:

- **Base64 encoding:** Kubernetes Secrets are often base64-encoded, but this is **not** encryption; it's just encoding. Anyone with access to the cluster can easily decode the values. Hence, the recommended best practice is to enable encryption in transit and at rest.
- **Access controls complexity:** Access control to secrets is limited to namespace level. If you need to share secrets across namespaces or have more granular access control, you might need to implement additional solutions or consider external secret management tools.
- **Limited versioning:** Kubernetes Secrets don't have built-in support for versioning. If you need to manage different versions of a secret, you may need to implement a naming convention or use an external tool for versioned secret management.
- **No Audit trail:** Kubernetes doesn't provide a built-in audit trail for changes to Secrets. This lack of visibility can make it challenging to track who accessed or modified a secret and when. External auditing tools or additional configurations may be necessary.
- **Difficulty in key rotation:** Kubernetes Secrets do not provide a built-in mechanism for key rotation. If you need to regularly rotate keys or secrets, you'll need to implement a custom solution or use an external tool.
- **Limited secret types:** Kubernetes Secrets are primarily designed for simple key-value pairs. If you need to manage more complex data structures or different types of secrets, you may need to consider external solutions or custom resources.
- **Difficulty in synchronizing with external systems:** If you have secrets managed outside of Kubernetes (e.g., in a password manager or a different secret store), synchronizing them with Kubernetes Secrets might require custom scripts or external tools.

To address these challenges, you may consider using external secret management tools like [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets), or other solutions that provide enhanced security features and more flexible secret management capabilities.
