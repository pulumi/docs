Pulumi offers APIs for working with a wide variety of cloud platforms, as well
as higher-level APIs that make it easier to deliver cloud applications and
infrastructure.

These APIs are available as packages in your chosen language's package manager
&mdash; NPM for Node.js and PyPI for Python. There is a dedicated package for
each cloud that includes access to its full capabilities. In addition, Pulumi
offers many convenience packages that make common tasks easier, like setting
up a network, creating a Kubernetes cluster, and building and publishing containers
to private registries.

These packages can be mixed to enable multi-cloud and a spectrum of control to productivity:

* Go (coming soon!)
