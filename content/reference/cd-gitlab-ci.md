This page details how to use [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/) to manage deploying
staging and production stacks based on commits to specific Git branches. This is sometimes
referred to as Push-to-Deploy.

Pulumi doesn't require any particular arrangement of stacks or workflow to work in a
continuous integration / continuous deployment system. So the steps described here can be
altered to fit into any existing type of deployment setup.

## Prerequisites
- An account on https://app.pulumi.com and that you have created a new project.
  - This just means you will sign-in using your GitLab credentials.
  - However, pulumi can be run from anywhere and your infrastrucutre code itself can be hosted anywhere.
- The latest CLI. Installation instructions are [here]({{< relref "/quickstart/install.md" >}}).
- A bare repo and set the remote URL to be your GitLab project.

## Stack and Branch Mappings
The scripts below act on a hypothetical stack: `acme/product-catalog-service-stack`.
You can create a stack by running `pulumi stack init`.
The source code for the stack is in a repository in GitLab and uses `TypeScript` as the language.

**Note**: The names used above are purely for demonstration purposes only.
You may choose a naming convention that best suits your organization.

Alternatively, you can also run `pulumi new [template]` to create a template project.
Learn more [here]({{< relref "cli/pulumi_new.md" >}}).

## GitLab CI Runners

## Protected Branches
In order to prevent abuse of protected resources, as well as some sensitive information used
by your repository, GitLab has the concept of [Protected Branches and Tags](https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/protected_branches.md).

If you are running `pulumi` from any branch other than the `master` branch,
you are likely to hit an error that the `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` 
environment variable (introduced later in this document) cannot be accessed.
You can fix this by specifying a wildcard regex to allow specific branches to
be able to access the secret environment variables. Please refer to the GitLab
documentation link above to learn how to do that.

## Merge Request Builds
GitLab CI currently does not yet support creating pipelines specifically for merge requests.
Because of this, pipelines will be created for every single branch that you push up.
You can apply some amount of control with the use of the configuration variables
`only` and `except`. You may also consider using `only:changes`, however,
note that there are some caveats to that. You can learn more [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#only-changes).

> See [this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/23902) issue for _community edition_ and 
[this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7380) issue for _enterprise edition_ to learn more.

## Environment Variables
To use Pulumi within GitLab CI, there are a few environment variables you'll need to set for each
build.

The first is `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN`, which is required to authenticate with pulumi.com in order to
perform the preview or update. You can create a new Pulumi access token specifically for your
CI/CD job on your [Pulumi Account page](https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens).

Next, you will also need to set environment variables specific to your cloud resource provider.
For example, if your stack is managing resources on AWS, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

**Note**: It is a good security practice to mark any sensitive variables as protected in GitLab.
Please read the note about **Protected Branches** above.

## Scripts

Your repository must contain the `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root. GitLab looks there by default.
If you are using an alternate location, be sure to update the settings for your GitLab project
by going to https://gitlab.com > (select your project) > Settings > General.

The following are samples only. You may choose to structure your configuration any way you like.

The `pulumi-preview.sh` script (not shown here) is similar to the `run-pulumi.sh`, except that
it runs the `pulumi preview` command instead of the `pulumi up` command, which is sort of a dry-run
that only shows you changes (if any) in your infrastructure.

### Sample `.gitlab-ci.yml`
```yaml
#
# This sample yaml configuration file contains two stages and three jobs.
# This configuration uses GitLab's `only`, `when`, and `except` configuration
# options to create a pipeline that will create the `pulumi-preview` job in the pipeline,
# for all branches except the master.
# Only for master branch merges, the main `pulumi` job is executed automatically.
# 
stages:
  - build
  - infrastructure-update

# Each stage may require multiple jobs to complete that stage.
# Consider a build stage, which may require building the UI, service, and a CLI.
# All 3 individual build jobs can be attributed to the build _stage_.
complex_build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "pulumi rocks!"

pulumi:
  stage: infrastructure-update
  before_script:
    - chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh
    - ./scripts/setup.sh
  script:
    - ./scripts/run-pulumi.sh
  # Create an artifact archive with just the pulumi log file,
  # which is created using console-redirection in run-pulumi.sh.
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - pulumi-log.txt
    # This is just a sample of how artifacts can be expired (removed) automatically in GitLab.
    # You may choose to not set this at all based on your organization's or team's preference.
    expire_in: 1 week
  # This job should only be created if the pipeline is created for the master branch.
  only:
    refs:
      - master
pulumi-preview:
  stage: infrastructure-update
  before_script:
    - chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh
    - ./scripts/setup.sh
  script:
    - ./scripts/pulumi-preview.sh
  # This job may only be triggered manually,
  # even though the pipeline is created, 
  # when a non-master branch is pushed-up.
  when: manual
  # This job should be created in the pipeline only if it is not the master branch.
  except:
    refs:
      - master
```

### `setup.sh`

The `setup.sh` installs the `pulumi` CLI on the GitLab CI Runner, and other tools.
It also installs `yarn` and `nodejs` since that's the runtime for this sample project.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# exit if a command returns a non-zero exit code and also print the commands and their args as they are executed
set -e -x
# Download and install required tools.
# pulumi
curl -L https://get.pulumi.com/ | bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.pulumi/bin
# Login into pulumi. This will require the PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable
pulumi login
# update the GitLab Runner's packages
apt-get update -y
apt-get install sudo -y
# nodejs
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
# yarn
npm i -g yarn
```

### `run-pulumi.sh`

The `run-pulumi.sh` script runs the `pulumi up` command to apply any stack changes and to start
updating your infrastructure.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# exit if a command returns a non-zero exit code and also print the commands and their args as they are executed
set -e -x

# Add the pulumi CLI to the PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.pulumi/bin

yarn install
pulumi stack select product-catalog-service
# The following is just a sample config setting that the hypothetical pulumi
# program needs.
# Learn more about pulumi configuration at: {{< absurl "/reference/config/" >}}
pulumi config set mysetting:myvalue
pulumi up
```
