title: Supported Languages
---

Pulumi is a multi-language runtime. Your choice of language does not affect which [clouds](clouds.html) may be
targeted -- each language is just as capable as the other and supports the entire surface area of resources available.

* [Node.js](javascript.html) - JavaScript, TypeScript, or any other Node.js compatible language
* [Python 3](python.html) - Python 3.6 or greater
* Go - statically compiled Go binaries (*documentation coming soon*)

If your favorite language isn't listed, it may be on its way soon. (It is, in fact, possible
[to add your own language](faq.html#how-can-i-add-support-for-my-favorite-language).)
In either case, please [contact us](troubleshooting.html) to inquire and let us know what you're looking for.
