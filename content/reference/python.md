Pulumi supports programs written in Python 3.

> **Note:** As of Pulumi 0.16.4, we have removed support for Python 2.7, and only support Python 3.6 or greater. You must
> have installed Python 3.6 prior to running Pulumi programs, or you will likely see syntax errors - Pulumi makes use of
> new Python syntax that is not backwards-compatible with Python 2. Older Pulumi versions did support Python 2.7.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with Pulumi Python is by using a template.  From an empty directory in which you'd like to create a new project:

```
$ mkdir myproject && cd myproject
$ pulumi new python
```

This will leave behind a `Pulumi.yaml` file, containing some minimal metadata about your project (including a name and description which you may wish to change), a `requirements.txt` file, where you will specify your dependencies (see #pypi-packages below), and a `__main__.py` file, containing your program.

> **Note:** Although the template uses a very simple package structure, by placing `__main__.py` in the root directory, Pulumi fully supports [properly modularized Python programs](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/) and `setup.py` files.  This is important if you ever decide to turn your Pulumi program into a library.

> **Note:** Pulumi currently expects the `python` executable to refer to a Python of version 3.6 or above. This is
> usually not the case when running outside of a virtual environment. To work around around this and explicitly ask
> Pulumi to run your program using `python3` you can set the `PULUMI_PYTHON_CMD` environment variable to `python3`. This
> will be addressed in future versions of Pulumi.

## Using Pulumi PyPI Packages {#pypi-packages}

It is not required, but we recommend using [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for repeatable installations that work no matter your operating system.

```
$ pipenv --python 3
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

`pipenv shell` launches a subshell with your virtual environment already activated. We highly recommend using virtual
environments to isolate the dependencies of your projects and ensure reproducibility between machines.

### Adding a new dependency {#packages}
