Pulumi's [GitHub Actions](https://developer.github.com/actions) help you deploy apps and infrastructure
to your cloud of choice, using nothing but code in your favorite language and GitHub. This includes previewing,
validating, and collaborating on proposed deployments in the context of Pull Requests, and triggering deployments
or promotions between different environments by merging or directly committing changes.

Let's see how to get started -- it's easy!

> **Note**: Remember that GitHub Actions is in private beta right now. Please
> [register for access](https://github.com/features/actions) here. Until you've been added, the **Actions**
> tab won't show in your repos, and the `.pulumi/main.workflow` file will do nothing. Also note that these
> features will only work on private repos in the specific account that has been granted access.

# Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding, you'll need to [Sign Up for Pulumi](https://app.pulumi.com/) (if you haven't already).

For your workflow to do anything interesting, you'll want to create a new project. There are three ways to do this:

1. [Clone an Existing Example](https://github.com/pulumi/examples)
2. [Use the New Project Wizard](https://app.pulumi.com/site/new-project)
3. [Download the CLI]({{< relref "/quickstart/install.md" >}}) and run `pulumi new` to select a template

# Creating a Workflow

Although the full power of the Pulumi CLI is available to use with GitHub Actions, we recommend starting with
our standard workflow. This workflow consists of two actions

1. **Pulumi Deploy (Current Stack)** deploys a commit to the current branch by running `pulumi up`
2. **Pulumi Preview (Merged Stack)** shows a preview of what would happen if a PR was merged, by running `pulumi preview`

From here, there are two ways to configure actions in your repo: doing it manually by committing workflow files and
configuring secrets, or using the visual editor. We'll start with the file-based approach -- but, if you prefer the
interactive workflow editor, please scroll down.

## Committing the Workflow File

Let's get started by adding the workflow file.

To set up the workflow to run anytime you commit or modify a PR, add the following to `.github/main.workflow`:

```hcl
workflow "Update" {
    on = "push"
    resolves = [ "Pulumi Deploy (Current Stack)" ]
}

action "Pulumi Deploy (Current Stack)" {
    uses = "docker://pulumi/actions"
    args = [ "up" ]
    env = {
        "PULUMI_CI" = "up"
    }
    secrets = [
        "PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ]
}

workflow "Preview" {
    on = "pull_request"
    resolves = "Pulumi Preview (Merged Stack)"
}

action "Pulumi Preview (Merged Stack)" {
    uses = "docker://pulumi/actions"
    args = [ "preview" ]
    env = {
        "PULUMI_CI" = "pr"
    }
    secrets = [
        "PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ]
}
```

This file is also available [here](https://github.com/pulumi/actions/blob/master/examples/main.workflow).

Also note that this workflow file will automatically download and use the latest version of Pulumi. If you prefer
to use a specific version of Pulumi, you can replace all occurrences of `uses = "docker://pulumi/actions"` with
a container image that contains the version as a tag, for instance `uses = "docker://pulumi/actions:v0.16.6"`.

Now you've got a workflow defined, but before you're ready to use it, you'll need to configure your secrets.

## Configuring Your Secrets

After committing the workflow file into your repo as `.github/main.workflow`, head on over to your
repo's **Settings tab**, where you will find the new **Secrets area**:

![Secrets](/images/reference/gh-actions-secrets.png)

First, [create a Pulumi Access Token](https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens), and enter it as `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
This enables your GitHub Action to communicate with the Pulumi service.

Next, you'll need to configure your cloud credentials. This is dependent on your cloud of choice; for example

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for [AWS]({{< relref "/quickstart/aws/setup.md" >}})
* `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `ARM_TENANT_ID` for [Azure]({{< relref "/quickstart/azure/setup.md" >}})
* `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` for [GCP]({{< relref "/quickstart/gcp/setup.md" >}})
* `KUBECONFIG` for [Kubernetes]({{< relref "/quickstart/kubernetes/setup.md" >}})

Enter these as secrets, just like you did `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN`, so that your GitHub Action can deploy to your cloud.

> **Important**: Make sure to also add these to your workflow action's `secrets` section, otherwise GitHub Actions
> won't make them available to the running container, and things will behave as if you didn't set them at all!

# Try It Out!

To try things out, simply create a Pull Request or commit, and you will see these new actions showing up in
the usual GitHub Checks dialog, with a green checkmark if everything went as planned:

![Action Checks](/images/reference/gh-actions-checks.png)

Click the Logs pane to see the full output of the Pulumi CLI, along with a hyperlink to your deployment on
Pulumi's Cloud Console with more details:

![Action Logs](/images/reference/gh-actions-logs.png)

For even better Pull Request integration, make sure to also [install our GitHub App]({{< relref "cd-github.md" >}})!

# Using the Visual Editor

All of the above can be done using the visual editor if you prefer. We have listed the manual instructions
because not everybody will see the new UI while GitHub Actions is in preview. But after your initial setup,
this UI will become available, and you may find it more convenient to edit things visually.

1. Go to your repo on GitHub, and click on the new **Actions** tab:

    ![Editor Actions Tab](/images/reference/gh-actions-editor-tab.png)

2. Click the **Create a new workflow** button:

    ![Editor Create Workflow](/images/reference/gh-actions-editor-create.png)

3. Click the **&lt;&gt; Edit new file** tab:

    ![Editor New File](/images/reference/gh-actions-editor-newfile.png)

4. Replace the default workflow with the suggested Pulumi workflow described above (
   [see here](https://github.com/pulumi/actions/blob/master/examples/main.workflow)):

    ![Editor Workflow Edit](/images/reference/gh-actions-editor-edit.png)

If you select the **Visual editor** tab, you'll see the resulting workflow actions, and all secrets may be edited:

![Editor Visual Edit](/images/reference/gh-actions-editor-visual.png)

To edit your secrets, scroll down and select the first Pulumi action, and click **Edit**:

![Editor Edit](/images/reference/gh-actions-editor-configure.png)

This will open the action editor on the right-hand side, in which you'll enter your various credentials (for Pulumi and
your cloud). After configuring these, you should see the green secrets with lock icons show up for your actions:

![Editor Secrets](/images/reference/gh-actions-editor-secrets.png)

# Pull Request Flow

If you are using Pulumi's GitHub Actions to preview infrastructure changes from Pull Requests, you may want to
have Pulumi comment on those PRs so that you don't need to look at the specific update logs to see if there
were any changes.

There are two ways to do this: using the Pulumi GitHub App (recommended), or configuring the GitHub Actions
container directly.

## Pulumi GitHub App

The [Pulumi GitHub App]({{< relref "cd-github.md" >}}) is something you install into your GitHub
organization, that will allow the Pulumi service to leave comments on Pull Requests. (It will not have access
to your source code.)

Once the Pulumi GitHub App is installed, when your GitHub Actions run Pulumi, a summary of any resource changes
is left on the Pull Request. As well as links to the Pulumi Cloud Console for more detailed information.

You can install the Pulumi GitHub App now, by visiting [github.com/apps/pulumi](https://github.com/apps/pulumi)
or clicking the button below.

<a href="https://github.com/apps/pulumi" target="_blank">
    <button class="button">INSTALL</button>
</a>

Example comment when using the Pulumi GitHub App:

## Comments By GitHub Actions

If you don't want to use the Pulumi GitHub App, you can configure Pulumi's GitHub Actions to copy the output
of the pulumi invocation on the pull request. This option doesn't have as rich of an output display as the
Pulumi GitHub App, and just copies the raw output of the Pulumi command-line.

To do this you need to set the `COMMENT_ON_PR` environment variable, and add the `GITHUB_TOKEN` value to
the secrets passed to the GitHub Action step. For example, 

```
action "Pulumi Preview (Merged Stack)" {
  uses = "docker://pulumi/actions"
  args = ["preview"]
  env = {
    PULUMI_CI = "pr"
    COMMENT_ON_PR = "1"
  }
  secrets = [
    "PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "GITHUB_TOKEN",
  ]
}
```

Example comment when using GitHub Actions directly:

# Configuration

You can configure how Pulumi's GitHub Actions work to have more control about which stacks get updated, and when.

## Using a Different Root Directory

By default, the Pulumi GitHub Action assumes your Pulumi project is in your repo's root directory. If you are using a
different root directory for your project, simply set the `PULUMI_ROOT` variable in your workflow. For example

```
action "Pulumi Deploy (Current Stack)" {
    ...
    env = {
        "PULUMI_ROOT" = "infra"
    }
}
```

This tells Pulumi that the project can be found underneath the repo's `infra` directory.

## Branch Mappings

Pulumi has a concept of *stacks*, which are isolated environments for your application (e.g., production, staging, or
even distinct services). By default, the GitHub Action will assume a project has a single stack, and will associate the
`master` branch with it. For sophisticated scenarios, this can be overridden in the `.pulumi/ci.json` file.

This is simply a JSON map. For example:

```json
{
    "master": "production",
    "staging": "staging"
}
```

Often, we'll map `master` to a `production` stack, and `staging` to a distinct `staging` stack, for example, and then
use Pull Requests to promote code between the two. This mappings file is intentionally flexible.

Note that you'll need to create these stacks in the usual way using Pulumi's service console or CLI. After setting this
up, everything will be on autopilot.
