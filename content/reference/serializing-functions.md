title: Serializing JavaScript Functions
aliases: ["serializing-functions.html"]

The Pulumi Node.js SDK provides a core API for converting a JavaScript function into all the code and files necessary to then have that function be used at runtime within some Cloud, for example in an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

There are many cases where a small piece of runtime functionality must be defined as part of a Cloud application, and it may make sense to define that runtime functionality directly inline as part of the Pulumi program. This can augment, or even replace, using runtime code and binaries defined outside of Pulumi in Lambda ZIPs, Docker images, VM images, etc.

Pulumi makes this easy by allowing JavaScript callbacks written in a Pulumi program to be serialized down into an artifact that can be used at runtime.  This function serialization feature moves code between stages of your application lifecycle - from 'deployment time' to 'run time'. 'deployment time' code runs during a `pulumi preview` or `pulumi up`, while 'run time' code runs when the corresponding Cloud artifact is triggered. It is thus important to understand how this is done, and some of the restrictions placed on code in a Pulumi program that is intended to be invoked at 'run time'.

For the purposes of this walkthrough, and for the examples, AWS-Lambda will be assumed.  But this information equally applies to all Cloud providers.  In a similar vein, TypeScript will be used to help provide type annotation for clarity.  However, TypeScript is not required, and all functionality is exposed entirely to JavaScript.  The API that exposes this functionality for AWS can be found in @pulumi/aws-serverless and can be accessed directly like so:

```typescript
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
import * as serverless from "@pulumi/aws-serverless";

const lambda: aws.lambda.Function = serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda", 
    (input: MyInputType) => {
        // your code here ...
        return someOutput;
    });
```

There are also many indirect ways this API is used.  Many Pulumi SDK APIs allow JavaScript functions to be passed that will be used to define the Lambda that will end up responsible for the code at 'run time'.  These APIs normally provide a strongly-typed definition that helps TypeScript users ensure their JavaScript functions are properly typed and will execute properly at 'run time'.  For example:

```typescript
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
import * as serverless from "@pulumi/aws-serverless";

const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("mybucket", { serverSideEncryptionConfiguration: ... });

// Can provide a JS function here that will end up producing an Lambda that will
// be triggered in the cloud whenever an aws.s3.Object is created inside our Bucket.
// This will create the lambda using the serverless.function.createLambdaFunction API.
serverless.s3.onObjectCreated("mytrigger", bucket, (eventInfo) => {
   for (const record of eventInfo.Records) {
       // process each record we're notified about.
   }
});
```

This functionality provides a powerful and convenient way to create your Lambdas, without needing to manually create the index.js file,  package up all necessary node_modules directories, specify Roles or RolePolicyAttachments, upload S3 buckets, or do any of the normal work traditionally necessary.

### JavaScript Function Transformation

At a high-level, creating a Lambda out of a JavaScript function involves several conceptual phases and transformation steps.  The first step is determining all the functions used by the function that is being converted.  For example, if the code were:

```typescript
const lambda: aws.lambda.Function = serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda", 
    (input: MyInputType) => {
        foo(input);
        bar(input);
    });

function foo(input: MyInputType) {
    quux(input)
}

function bar(input: MyInputType) {
}

function quux(input: MyInputType) {
}

function ztesch() {
}
```

The primary JavaScript function ends up calling both 'foo' and 'bar', so both these functions will be analyzed, transformed and included in the 'run time' code as well.  When 'foo' is transformed it will see that 'quux' is called, so that function will also be processed.  However, 'ztesch' is never called.  So it will not be included.

All functions that are needed for 'run time' execution will then be included in uploaded code included for the Lambda.  Generally speaking, this code is almost always included as originally written, ensuring that the serialized code behaves as close as possible to the original code definition.  It is a primary goal of Pulumi that the semantics of the 'run time' code match the semantics of the original program's code.

### 'Capturing' Values in a JavaScript Function

For most functions, the code of the function can simply be included practically 'as is' in the code file for the Lambda.  The important exception to this are functions that 'capture' values defined outside of the function itself.  For example:

```typescript
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = new aws.s3.Bucket("mybucket", { serverSideEncryptionConfiguration: /*...*/ });
const obj3 = SomeFunction();

const lambda: aws.lambda.Function = serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda", 
    (input: MyInputType) => {
        foo(obj1);
        foo(obj2);
        foo(obj3);
    });

function foo(o) {
}
```

In this code, the JavaScript function ends up capturing 'obj1', 'obj2', and 'obj3' from outside the function. If the code `(input: MyInputType) => { foo(obj1); /*...*/ }` were captured 'as-is' inside the Lambda, then it would simply fail to work properly when triggered in the cloud because the values for 'obj1' and the rest would not exist.  In order to support this, `pulumi` will analyze these functions to determine what values are captured, and it will "serialize" them into a form that can then be retrieved and used at 'run time' for use by the actual Lambda.

The actual process of serialization is conceptually straightforward.  Because JavaScript itself allows unimpeded reflection over values, `pulumi` uses this to serialize the entire object graph for the referenced JavaScript value, including the prototype chain, properties and methods on the object and any values those transitively reference.

Because of this, almost all JavaScript values can be serialized with very few exceptions.  Importantly, Pulumi Resources themselves are captured in this fashion, allowing 'run time' code to simply references the defined Resources of a Pulumi application and to use them when a Lambda is triggered.  

Notes:
1. One notable limitation of this system is that native-functions are not capturable.  This impacts capturing any value that is either itself a native function or which *transitively* references a native from being capturable.
2. Each time the Cloud Lambda is triggered these values will be rehydrated.  This happens immediately before the code for the Lambda itself starts executing.
3. Any mutations made to those values will be seen across a single  invocation of that Lambda.  However, it will not be seen by subsequent invocations.  They will always start with the original value that was captured.  This behavior is similar to how a web-page works, where each client that visits the pages will get their own fresh copy of variables, and will not see mutations made by other clients on other machines.

### Size of Captured Values

Pulumi will attempt to reduce the size of a serialized object by removing parts of it that it can prove are not used in a program.  For example:

```typescript
const obj = { foo() { console.log("foo called"); } bar() { console.log("bar called") } };

const lambda: aws.lambda.Function = serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda", 
    (input: MyInputType) => {
        obj.foo();
    });
```

In this code, only the 'foo' property is used from 'obj'.  So Pulumi will serialize a value equivalent to `{ foo() { console.log("foo called"); } }`.  However, if the code were:

```typescript
const obj = { foo() { console.log("foo called"); this.bar(); } bar() { console.log("bar called") } };

const lambda: aws.lambda.Function = serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda", 
    (input: MyInputType) => {
        obj.foo();
    });
```

Then this would need to serialize the entire object value (because 'bar' itself is used from 'foo').  This process happens conservatively. By default objects are serialized in their entirety, and they are only trimmed down when it can be proved that it is totally safe to do so.

### 'Capturing' Modules in a JavaScript Function

Capturing of most JavaScript values normally works by serializing the entire object graph to produce a representation which can then be rehydated into a replica instance.  However, this process works differently when the value being dealt with is a JavaScript module.  For example, consider the following code:

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";

const lambda: aws.lambda.Function = serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda", 
    async (input: MyInputType) => {
        await fs.writeFile("example.txt", "data");
    });
```

In this example the 'fs' module is needed inside the 'run time' code.  Because a module is just a normal JavaScript value, it would be possible to serialize it just like any other value.  However, for several reasons this is not done:

1. It would generate an enormous amount of serialized code.  This code would then have quite an impact on the time necessary to execute the lambda each time it was invoked.  
2. It would be redundant to have this code serialized out given that the equivalent code will exist in the node_modules directory for the Lambda.
3. It would fail on a native-code function.  These functions are relatively common in real-world modules, and would greatly limit the ability to use a module in practice.

Because of these reasons, Modules are captured in a special, but intuitive fashion.  When a module is captured in code, it is translated into a idiomatic `require` call in the serialized JavaScript code.  Using the above example, the code will then effectively contain:

```javascript
var fs = require("fs");

// ...

await fs.writeFile("example.txt", "data")
```

This ensures that all modules can be referenced simply in application code, and then used simply in 'run time' code with expected semantics.

Notes:
1. this form of module capturing only applies to external modules that are referenced.  i.e. modules that are directly part of Node, or are in the node_modules directory.  The 'local' module (i.e. the module for the Pulumi application itself) is not captured in this fashion.  That's because this code will not actually be part of the uploaded node_modules, and so would not be found.  The 'local' module is captured as if it was a normal 'value'.  This means, all its relevant variable and functions are serialized over in a uniform fashion to the Lambda, regardless of which actual file/module they are contained in. 

### Pulumi Execution Order

`pulumi` uses `node` to execute a Pulumi application.  During execution, when a call to `createLambdaFunction` is encountered, the function is converted to a Lambda at that point in execution.  That means that if the function captures any state, then the value that is captured will be whatever it was at the point in time.

For this reason, it is highly recommended that code not capture values which are also mutated in code.  It is much safer and easier to reason about immutable values that are captured in code.

To see the problems this avoids in practice, consider the following two programs:

```typescript
let obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };

const lambda: aws.lambda.Function = serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda", 
    () => {
        console.log(obj);
    });

obj = { a: 3, b: 4 };
```


```typescript
let obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
obj = { a: 3, b: 4 };

const lambda: aws.lambda.Function = serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda", 
    () => {
        console.log(obj);
    });
```

When `pulumi` starts executing `createLambdaFunction` it will analyze the JavaScript function code and will see that it uses the 'obj' value.  At that point in time it will use whatever the value is currently to serialize over.  So, in the first example, it will serialize the value `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`, even though right after executing createLambdaFunction the program code will update that value to `{ a: 3, b: 4}`.  In the second example, the code will see the `{ a: 3, b: 4 }` value and will serialize that into the 'run time' code.  

Notes:
1. there are subtleties here with Promise-like values.  When `pulumi` encounters a Promise value that it needs to serialize into the code for a Lambda, it will actually `await` that Promise.  During that `await`, 'node' can then execute more of the program application code.  This means that later code may execute which then changes a value which is captured by the JavaScript function.  If `pulumi` then serialized that value after serializing the Promise, then it may see the mutated value.

So, in the following code:

```typescript
let obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
let pr = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { /*...*/ });

const lambda: aws.lambda.Function = serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda", 
    () => {
        console.log(pr);
        console.log(obj);
    });

obj = { a: 3, b: 4 };
```

it may be the case that the value `{ a: 1, b: 2}` or `{ a: 3, b: 4}` is serialized depending on the order that things are serialized in.  As above, it is highly recommended to not mutate values that are captured *especially* in the presence of asynchronously executing code.

### Customizing the Cloud Lambda Produced from a JavaScript Function

By default, Pulumi will generate a Cloud Lambda for a given JavaScript function with reasonable defaults for many configurable properties.  For example, values are picked to define the default roles and permissions for the Lambda, the timeout it should have, how much memory it can use, which version of the Node runtime to use, and so on and so forth.  If these defaults are not desirable, any or all of them can be overridden by supplying desired values.  For example:

```typescript
// Only let this Lambda run for a minute before forcefully terminating it.
const options: serverless.function.FunctionOptions = { timeout: 60 };

const lambda: aws.lambda.Function = serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda", 
    (input: MyInputType) => {
        // your code here ...
        return someOutput;
    }, options);
```

When calling APIs that allow callbacks to be passed in, customization can be provided like so:

```typescript
// Only let this Lambda run for a minute before forcefully terminating it.
const options: serverless.function.FunctionOptions = { timeout: 60 };

serverless.s3.onObjectCreated("mytrigger", bucket, 
    serverless.function.createLambdaFunction("mylambda" (eventInfo) => {
       for (const record of eventInfo.Records) {
           // process each record we're notified about.
    }, options));
```

In other words, the Lambda will first be created with appropriate values overridden.  Then that Lambda itself can be passed in as the code to run for the specific API.

### Determining the Appropriate node_modules Packages to include with a Lambda

Because a Pulumi application contains both 'deployment time' code and 'run time' code, it is necessary for the program's `package.json` definition to have a `dependencies` section which specifies all necessary packages needed for both execution times.  When `pulumi` and produces a Lambda from a user-provided function, it will transitively include all packages specified in that `dependencies` section in the final uploaded Lambda.

Notes:
1. `pulumi` will not include `@pulumi/...` packages with the Lambda.  These packages exist solely to provide 'deployment time' functionality, and do not contain any code that can work properly at 'run time'.  They are automatically stripped from a Lambda both to prevent accidently usage, as well as to help reduce the size of the uploaded Lambda.

AWS-Specific Notes:
1. It is optional to specify a reference to "aws-sdk" in your package.json.  AWS always includes this package with Lambdas, and so it is not necessary to explicitly include it yourself.
