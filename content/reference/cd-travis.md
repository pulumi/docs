title: Travis CI
---

This page details how to use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) to manage deploying
staging and production stacks based on commits to specific Git branches. This is sometimes
referred to as Push-to-Deploy.

Pulumi doesn't require any particular arrangement of stacks or workflow to work in a
continuous integration / continuous deployment system. So the steps described here can be
altered to fit into any existing type of deployment setup.

## Stack and Branch Mappings

The scripts below act on two hypothetical stacks: `acme/website-staging` and
`acme/website-production`. The source code for both stacks are in the same repository. And we will
update the `website-staging` stack whenever code is pushed into the `master` branch, and update the
`website-production` stack whenever code is pushed into the `production` branch.

We will also run previews of infrastructure changes for pull requests into the `master` and
`production` branches, to identify an potentially impactful changes before they get merged.

## Configuring Travis

To support this deployment strategy, you need to enable Travis to create both `push` and
`pull_request` jobs. In the Travis UI, this is done by checking the "Build pushed branches" and
"Build pushed pull requests" options.

`push` jobs are created when a Git push is made to a branch. We configure the build script for
`push` jobs to run `pulumi up`, i.e. carry out the push-to-deploy operation.

`pull_request` jobs are created when a push is made to a _pull request topic branch_. (That same
push will also trigger a separate `push` job.) We configure the `pull_request` job to run
`pulumi preview` to see any infrastructure changes that would happen as _a result of_ the pull
request being merged.

### Environment Variables

To use Pulumi within Travis CI, there are a few environment variables you'll need to set for each
build.

The first is `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN`, which is required to authenticate with pulumi.com in order to
perform the preview or update. You can create a new Pulumi access token specifically for your
CI/CD job on your [Pulumi Account page](https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens).

Next, you will also need to set environment variables specific to your cloud resource provider.
For example, if your stack is managing resources on AWS, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

## Scripts

With Travis configured, we then just need to add three files to the repository:
`.travis.yml`, `scripts/travis_push.sh`, and `scripts/travis_pull_request.sh`. (Though of course
you are free to rename and/or move these files to whatever makes sense in your repo.)

### Travis.yaml

The following is a minimal `.travis.yml`, which describes the steps Travis CI will perform as part
of building the repository.

If you already have an existing Travis configuration file, the only thing you'll need to add are
the steps to download the Pulumi CLI and add it to the path.

The example `.travis.yml` file then calls either `scripts/travis_pull.sh` or
`scripts/travis_pull_request.sh`, depending on the build type. However, if you already have a
build script or `Makefile` target to deploy your software, you can simply add the commands
to run Pulumi to that.

```yaml
language: generic
before_install:
  - curl -L https://get.pulumi.com/ | bash -s -- --version 0.14.3
  - export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.pulumi/bin
script:
  - ./scripts/travis_${TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE}.sh
```

### scripts/travis_push.sh

`scripts/travis_push.sh` is the script that is executed on `push` jobs. And for the push-to-deploy stategy,
is when we will run `pulumi up`. For `push` jobs, the `TRAVIS_BRANCH` environment variable is the
pushed branch. So we use that to determine which stack to update, e.g. pushes to `master` update the
staging stack and `production` update the production stack.

We can do this in Bash using a simple switch statement.

```bash
echo "Travis push job"

# Download dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# Update the stack
case ${TRAVIS_BRANCH} in
    master)
        pulumi stack select acme/website-staging
        pulumi up --yes
        ;;
    production)
        pulumi stack select acme/website-production
        pulumi up --yes
        ;;
    *)
        echo "No Pulumi stack associated with branch ${TRAVIS_BRANCH}."
        ;;
esac
```

### scripts/travis_pull_request.sh

`scripts/travis_pull_request.sh` is triggered on pushes to a pull request branch. For these jobs
the meaning of `TRAVIS_BRANCH` is the branch being _targeted_ by the pull request.

So if the pull request is going to be merged into the `master` branch, then we would want to
preview the changes that would be made to the staging stack. For pull requests targeting the
`production` branch, we want to preview the production stack.

```bash
echo "Travis pull_request job"

# Download dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# Preview changes that would be made if the PR were merged.
case ${TRAVIS_BRANCH} in
    master)
        pulumi stack select acme/website-staging
        pulumi preview
        ;;
    production)
        pulumi stack select acme/website-production
        pulumi preview
        ;;
    *)
        echo "No Pulumi stack targeted by pull request branch ${TRAVIS_BRANCH}."
        ;;
esac
```

## Concurrency

When using Travis to continuously deploy your Pulumi stacks, you may run into a problem. What
happens if there are multiple commits merged into the `master` branch in rapid succession?

Travis will trigger multiple `push` jobs, which will then both try to run `pulumi up` on the
same stack at the same time.

Pulumi blocks any stack updates while one is already in progress. (To avoid conflicting resource
updates or corrupting resource state.) So the stack and its resources won't be harmed by the
concurrent update, but it will likely fail your Travis build.

There are a few ways to address this, such as preventing Travis from starting concurrent builds.
However, the recommended way is to use the [travisqueue](https://github.com/pulumi/travisqueue)
tool.

`travisqueue` is a tool that you can add to your `.travis.yml` file to limit build concurrency on
a per-branch basis. This allows you to limit the number of concurrent builds for any branches that
are configured to perform a Pulumi update. So Travis will only have one build for the `master`
branch at a time, but could be running any number of conrrent builds for other branches.

See the [README.md](https://github.com/pulumi/travisqueue/blob/master/README.md) file for more
information on how it works and how to add it to your Travis configuration file.
