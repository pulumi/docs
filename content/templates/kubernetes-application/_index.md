### Building and deploying applications on Kubernetes clusters

[Infrastructure as code](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/) is an efficient and repeatable way of building Kubernetes applications with programming languages and deploying them to your Kubernetes clusters.

Pulumiâ€™s open source, infrastructure as code SDK lets you build and deploy Kubernetes applications with TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, .NET, and YAML. The main benefits include:

* **Programming Languages:** Define infrastructure as code in your favorite language instead of domain-specific languages.

* **Cloud Native Ecosystem Support:** Use Helm charts and native Kubernetes API objects, including integrated Kustomize support, to deploy workloads to your Kubernetes cluster.

* **Fast, Easy Deployment:** Quickly deploy your Kubernetes applications with the CLI, with a [GitOps workflow](/docs/using-pulumi/continuous-delivery/pulumi-kubernetes-operator/), or from a CI/CD workflow.

* **Rapid Development:** Author, version, test, and release cluster and infrastructure changes just like software.
