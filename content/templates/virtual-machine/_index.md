### What are virtual machines?

Virtual Machines are virtualizations/emulations of a computer system that execute entire operating systems. Cloud providers offer on-demand virtual machines with a selection of processor, storage, networking, and operating system configurations with a variety of payment models.

**On [AWS](/aws),** you can provision virtual machines through Amazon EC2.

**On [Azure](/azure),** you can provision virtual machines through Azure Virtual Machines.

**On [Google Cloud](/gcp),** you can provision virtual machines through Google Compute Engine.

### Building and deploying virtual machines on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud

[Infrastructure as code](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) is an efficient and repeatable way of building a serverless application with programming languages and deploying the website to your preferred cloud.

Pulumiâ€™s open source, infrastructure as code SDK that lets you provision virtual machines with TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, .NET, and YAML. The main benefits include:

* **Programming Languages:** Define infrastructure as code in your favorite language instead of domain-specific languages or clicking through cloud consoles.

* **Unified Function and Infrastructure Code:** Manage cloud function code and infrastructure code together in a single program.

* **Fast, Easy Deployment:** Quickly deploy your infrastructure with a CLI or from a CI/CD workflow.

* **Rapid Development:** Author, version, test, and release infrastructure changes just like software.
