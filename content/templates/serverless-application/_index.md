### What are serverless applications?

[Serverless](/serverless/) applications use cloud services that feature automatic scaling, built-in high availability, and pay-for-use billing models, allowing you to build and run applications and services without having to provision, scale, and manage any servers yourself.

**On [AWS](/aws/),** you can build serverless applications using services like AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon S3.

**On [Azure](/azure/),** you can build serverless applications using services like Azure Functions.

**On [Google Cloud Platform](/gcp/),** you can build serverless applications using services like Google Cloud Functions.

### Building and deploying serverless infrastructure on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud

[Infrastructure as code](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/) is an efficient and repeatable way of building a serverless application with programming languages and deploying the website to your preferred cloud.

Pulumiâ€™s open source, infrastructure as code SDK that lets you build and deploy static websites with TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, .NET, and YAML. The main benefits include:

* **Programming Languages:** Define infrastructure as code in your favorite language instead of domain-specific languages or clicking through cloud consoles.

* **Unified Function and Infrastructure Code:** Manage cloud function code and infrastructure code together in a single program.

* **Fast, Easy Deployment:** Quickly deploy your serverless application with a CLI or from a CI/CD workflow.

* **Rapid Development:** Author, version, test, and release infrastructure changes just like software.
