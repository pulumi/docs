The Google Cloud Static Website template creates an infrastructure as code project in your favorite language that deploys an HTML website to Google Cloud Platform with Pulumi. It uses a [Cloud Storage bucket](/registry/packages/gcp/api-docs/storage/bucket/) for file storage, configures the storage account to host a website, and provisions a [Global Address](/registry/packages/gcp/api-docs/compute/globaladdress/) to route traffic to the CDN for lower latency and caching. The template generates a complete Pulumi program, including placeholder web content, to give you a working project out of the box that you can customize easily and extend to suit your needs.

## Using this template

To use this template to deploy a website of your own, make sure you've [installed Pulumi](/docs/install/) and [configured your Google Cloud credentials](/registry/packages/gcp/installation-configuration#credentials), then create a new [project](/docs/concepts/projects/) using the template in your language of choice:

{{< templates/pulumi-new >}}

Follow the prompts to complete the new-project wizard. When it's done, you'll have a finished project that's ready to deploy and configured with the most common settings. Feel free to inspect the code in {{< langfile >}} for a closer look.

## Deploying the project

The template requires no additional configuration. Once the new project is created, you can deploy it immediately with [`pulumi up`](/docs/cli/commands/pulumi_up):

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

When the deployment completes, Pulumi exports the following [stack output](/docs/concepts/stack#outputs) values:

originHostname
: The provider-assigned hostname of the Google Cloud Storage bucket.

originURL
: The fully-qualified HTTP URL of the storage bucket endpoint.

cdnHostname
: The provider-assigned hostname of the Google Cloud CDN. Useful for creating `CNAME` records to associate custom domains.

cdnURL
: The fully-qualified HTTP URL of the Google Cloud CDN.

Output values like these are useful in many ways, most commonly as inputs for other stacks or related cloud resources. The computed `cdnURL`, for example, can be used from the command line to open the newly deployed website in your favorite web browser:

```bash
$ open $(pulumi stack output cdnURL)
```

## Customizing the project

Projects created with the Static Website template expose the following [configuration](/docs/concepts/config/) settings:

path
: The path to the folder containing the files of the website. Defaults to `www`, which is the name (and relative path) of the folder included with the template.

indexDocument
: The file to use for top-level pages. Defaults to `index.html`.

errorDocument
: The file to use for error pages. Defaults to `error.html`.

All of these settings are optional and may be adjusted either by editing the stack configuration file directly (by default, `Pulumi.dev.yaml`) or by changing their values with [`pulumi config set`](/docs/cli/commands/pulumi_config_set) as shown below.

### Using your own web content

If you already have a static website you'd like to deploy on Google Cloud Platform with Pulumi, you can do so either by replacing placeholder content in the `www` folder or by configuring the stack to point to another folder on your computer with the `path` setting:

```bash
$ pulumi config set path ../my-existing-website/build
$ pulumi up
```

## Tidying up

You can cleanly destroy the stack and all of its infrastructure with [`pulumi destroy`](/docs/cli/commands/pulumi_destroy):

```bash
$ pulumi destroy
```
