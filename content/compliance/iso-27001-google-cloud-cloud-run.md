It helps organizations protect sensitive data by providing a risk-based approach, ensuring that security measures are proportionate to the risks faced. ISO 27001 is based around the following 3 pillars: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. By achieving ISO 27001 certification, organizations demonstrate their commitment to robust information security practices and regulatory compliance."
