description: "ISO 27001 is an internationally recognized standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS). It helps organizations protect sensitive data by providing a risk-based approach, ensuring that security measures are proportionate to the risks faced. ISO 27001 is based around the following 3 pillars: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. By achieving ISO 27001 certification, organizations demonstrate their commitment to robust information security practices and regulatory compliance."
whatis: "Google Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service that offers MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server instances. It provides high performance, scalability, and availability without the need for infrastructure management. Cloud SQL automates backups, replication, patches, and updates while ensuring data encryption and network security. With features like automatic storage increases, point-in-time recovery, and seamless integration with other Google Cloud services, Cloud SQL enables developers to focus on application development rather than database administration."
