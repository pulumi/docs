description: "PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance refers to the adherence to a set of security standards designed to protect card information during and after a financial transaction. These standards are established by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which was founded by major credit card companies like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB."
whatis: "Google Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service that offers MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server instances. It provides high performance, scalability, and availability without the need for infrastructure management. Cloud SQL automates backups, replication, patches, and updates while ensuring data encryption and network security. With features like automatic storage increases, point-in-time recovery, and seamless integration with other Google Cloud services, Cloud SQL enables developers to focus on application development rather than database administration."
