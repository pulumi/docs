        There is no way around the fact that devops is complicated but @PulumiCorp is a game changer for me.  Blows away CloudForamtion, TerraForm, CDK, etc.

        Without a doubt the most approachable tool in the IaaC space is
        @PulumiCorp.

        Somewhat enjoying provisioning a scheduled run of a Lambda.

        The developer experience of Pulumi is just sublime. As a prior Terraform user, the grass is substantially greener on this side. I'm so glad I made the switch two years back. Using Terraform for my current use case would be a massive downgrade.

        Deploying cloud resources using @PulumiCorp is just amazing. Why would anybody bother with JSON, YAML or some other DSL?

        Been using Pulumi with Typescript for a IaaC managing k8s and stateful databases. Don't see myself going back to using terraform after this.

        our team at @devseed is now gravitating toward using https://pulumi.com/docs/concepts/vs/terraform/ instead of terraform because it's all in python so it is easier to onboard new people to the tool and makes it easier to manage the same infra definition in different test, staging, and deploy envs.

        New gig uses @PulumiCorp to manage AWS infra. Initially I was skeptical and was tempted to go back to Terraform, but after using pulumi imports and discovering the ability to write tests easily, I'm a convert. (1/4)

        I love @PulumiCorp so much because it is like 50% of the reason why we dared to build https://planton.cloud.

        An equivalent of 50K lines of declarative infra code has been put behind APIs to support the features on the platform with https://www.pulumi.com/docs/using-pulumi/automation-api/
