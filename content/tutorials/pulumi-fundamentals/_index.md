summary: |
    In this tutorial, you’ll learn about cloud computing with Pulumi by building, configuring, and deploying a real-world, modern application with Docker. You’ll create a front-end interface, a back-end service, and a database to deploy a web application called the Pulumipus Boba Tea Shop. Along the way, you’ll learn more about how Pulumi works.

    For this tutorial, you’ll use Docker to learn the basics of deploying with Pulumi. You’ll create a Pulumi Project, build Docker images, and configure and provision containers with those images, all with Pulumi.

    The sample app we’ll be building, the Pulumipus Boba Tea Shop, is a progressive web application (PWA) built with MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and Node.js (the MERN stack). It’s a common stack used in e-commerce applications, adapted from [this repository](https://github.com/shubhambattoo/shopping-cart).
