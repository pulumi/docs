summary: |
  If you worked with Pulumi and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), you probably know that Pulumi has a [Kubernetes provider](/docs/iac/get-started/kubernetes/) that allows you to deploy Kubernetes resources.

  In this tutorial, we will learn how to install Helm chart on Kubernetes using Pulumi. [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to install and manage applications on your Kubernetes cluster.

  Most of the third-party applications that you want to install on your Kubernetes cluster, like whole monitoring stacks, databases, and other applications, are most likely available as Helm charts.

  On services like [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/), you can find a lot of Helm charts that you can use to install applications on your Kubernetes cluster.

  The Pulumi Kubernetes provider offers two different ways to install Helm on Kubernetes:

  - Using the `Release` resource
  - Using the `Chart` resource

  The Helm [Chart](/registry/packages/kubernetes/api-docs/helm/v4/chart) resource renders the templates from your chart and then manages the objects directly with the Pulumi Kubernetes provider.

  The Helm [Release](/registry/packages/kubernetes/api-docs/helm/v4/release) resource uses the Helm SDK to install the Helm chart on your Kubernetes cluster.

## Never heard of Helm?

What is Helm? Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes and a Helm chart is a collection of different Kubernetes (like Deployment, Service, Ingress, etc.) resources that are bundled together and can be deployed as a unit.

There are many ways to share Helm charts, but the most popular way is by using a Helm repository. Recently Helm supports also OCI registries as a way to share the Helm chart as an OCI artifact.

Additionally, Helm has a templating engine that allows you to customize the Helm chart before you deploy it. It is based on the go templating engine (plus Sprig functions) and allows you to customize the Helm chart based on your needs.

> This templating engine is also the reason why some folks are avoiding Helm. Things can get pretty complex if not taken care.

## Deploying a Helm chart with Pulumi

To start, [login to the Pulumi CLI](/tutorials/cli-authentication/) and create a new Pulumi project. You can use the following command to create a new Pulumi project and select from the list of templates the `helm-kubernetes-<your-programming-language>` template.

```bash
# Choose your favorite Pulumi supported language
pulumi new helm-kubernetes-<your-programming-language>
```

This will create a new Pulumi project with the necessary files to deploy Kubernetes resources and some example resources.

{{< chooser language "typescript,python,go,csharp,yaml" />}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```typescript
{{< example-program-snippet path="helm-kubernetes-part-one" language="typescript" from="1" to="45" >}}
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```python
{{< example-program-snippet path="helm-kubernetes-part-one" language="python" from="1" to="47" >}}
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```go
{{< example-program-snippet path="helm-kubernetes-part-one" language="go" from="1" to="66" >}}
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```csharp
{{< example-program-snippet path="helm-kubernetes-part-one" language="csharp" from="1" to="59" >}}
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```yaml
{{< example-program-snippet path="helm-kubernetes-part-one" language="yaml" from="1" to="53" >}}
```

{{% /choosable %}}

## Deploying the Helm chart

Now run the `pulumi up` command to preview and deploy the resources you’ve just defined in your project.

```bash
pulumi up
Please choose a stack, or create a new one: dev
Previewing update (dev)

View in Browser (Ctrl+O): https://app.pulumi.com/dirien/helm/dev/previews/88cf6d4c-d4a4-401f-9b25-cedd50146545

     Type                              Name               Plan
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack               helm-dev           create
 +   ├─ kubernetes:core/v1:Namespace   ingressns          create
 +   └─ kubernetes:helm.sh/v3:Release  ingresscontroller  create

Outputs:
    name: "ingresscontroller-7e4b854f"

Resources:
    + 3 to create

Do you want to perform this update? yes
Updating (dev)

View in Browser (Ctrl+O): https://app.pulumi.com/dirien/helm/dev/updates/1

     Type                              Name               Status
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack               helm-dev           created (15s)
 +   ├─ kubernetes:core/v1:Namespace   ingressns          created (0.32s)
 +   └─ kubernetes:helm.sh/v3:Release  ingresscontroller  created (7s)

Outputs:
    name: "ingresscontroller-b5455c41"

Resources:
    + 3 created

Duration: 17s
```

After the deployment is complete, you can check the resources in your Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kubectl get all -n nginx-ingress
```

And you should see the resources that were created by the Helm chart.

```bash
NAME                                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

replicaset.apps/ingresscontroller-b5455c41-nginx-ingress-5987c7bd56   1         1         1       104s
```

## Deploying an OCI Helm chart with Pulumi

In the previous example, we deployed a Helm chart from a Helm repository. Helm supports also [OCI registries](https://helm.sh/blog/storing-charts-in-oci/) as a way to share Helm charts. The changes in the Pulumi program are minimal.

```typescript
// omitting the namespace creation for brevity
const nodered = new k8s.helm.v3.Release("node-red", {
    name: "node-red",
    chart: "oci://ghcr.io/schwarzit/charts/node-red",
    namespace: "node-red",
    createNamespace: true,
});
```

The `chart` property now points to the OCI registry where the Helm chart is stored and you add the `oci://` prefix to the chart URL. You can also drop the `repositoryOpts` property since it is not needed when you deploy a Helm chart from an OCI registry.

## Housekeeping

Before moving on, tear down the resources that are part of your stack to avoid incurring any charges.

1. Run `pulumi destroy` to tear down all resources. You'll be prompted to make sure you really want to delete these resources. A destroy operation may take some time, since Pulumi waits for the resources to finish shutting down before it considers the destroy operation to be complete.
2. To delete the stack itself, run `pulumi stack rm`. Note that this command deletes all deployment history from the Pulumi Service.
