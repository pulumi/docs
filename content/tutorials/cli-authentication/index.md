summary: |
    The [`pulumi login`](/docs/cli/commands/pulumi_login/) command is used to login to the Pulumi Cloud from the [Pulumi CLI](/docs/cli/). Logging in to the Pulumi Cloud enables you to manage your state, resources, and secrets in a secure way. In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to authenticate to the Pulumi Cloud using the Pulumi CLI.

## Logging into the CLI

When you run the `pulumi login` command, you will be presented with a prompt that will offer you two methods of authenticating: either via access token or via the browser.

```bash
$ pulumi login
Manage your Pulumi stacks by logging in.
Run `pulumi login --help` for alternative login options.
Enter your access token from https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens
    or hit <ENTER> to log in using your browser                   :
```

{{< notes type="info" >}}

By default, logging into the Pulumi CLI will log you into the managed Pulumi Cloud backend, but it is also possible to use this command to login to a self-hosted Pulumi Cloud backend. This is out of the scope of this tutorial, but you can learn more by visiting the [Managing state & backend options documentation](/docs/iac/concepts/state-and-backends/#logging-into-and-out-of-state-backends).

{{< /notes >}}

In the next steps, you will learn how to login using both options, and you will also learn how to logout of the Pulumi CLI when you are done.

### Authenticate using a token

Run the `pulumi login` command to initiate the authentication process. When prompted, copy and paste your token into the command line and press enter.

{{< video title="Running the pulumi login command with access token" src="/tutorials/cli-authentication/aws-cli-pulumi-login-token.mp4" autoplay="true" loop="true" >}}

In the CLI, you will receive a message to indicate that you've successfully logged in.

### Authenticate using the browser

Run the `pulumi login` command to initiate the authentication process. When prompted, press enter to be directed to the browser. From there, login with the appropriate credentials:

{{< video title="Running the pulumi login command with browser" src="/tutorials/cli-authentication/aws-cli-pulumi-login-browser.mp4" autoplay="true" loop="true" >}}

In both the browser and the CLI, you will receive a message to indicate that you've successfully logged in.

{{< video title="Showing browser authentication completed" src="/tutorials/cli-authentication/aws-cli-pulumi-login-browser-success.mp4" autoplay="true" loop="true" >}}

## Logging out of the CLI

When you want to logout of the Pulumi CLI, run the [pulumi logout](/docs/cli/commands/pulumi_logout/) command. You will receive the following output that indicates you were logged out successfully:

```bash
$ pulumi logout
Logged out of https://api.pulumi.com
```

## Next Steps
