## About this tutorial

In this tutorial, we will explore how you could use Pulumi as an API for your infrastructure deployment and maintenance.

Note that this tutorial will not have a specific application and infrastructure to stand up. Rather, we're exploring the Pulumi system, so you can use either a code example of your own or one of ours.
