    description: >
        Serverless compute services offer an amazing power to application developers to leverage: highly available, automatically scaled, low-ceremony, pay-per-value functions created in several lines of code. With Pulumi’s cloud native SDKs, serverless gets more fun. Using general purpose languages, we can create resources, and then wire up event handlers, like in normal event-driven programming!
