  description: >
    This workshop will cover advanced infrastructure as code topics including
    using and authoring components, multi-stack architectures and testing - as
    well as how to apply infrastructure as code to Kubernetes - both for
    provisioning managed Kubernetes clusters and deploying Kubernetes
    applications and services on top of existing clusters.


    After completing this workshop, you’ll be up and running with IaC fundamentals, modern application architectures across many clouds, and Kubernetes best-practices that are ready for production environments. You’ll also be ready to empower your development teams to be more productive - continuously deploying both their applications and infrastructure.
