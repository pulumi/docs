  description: >
    The hardest part of Kubernetes is setting up the infrastructure: clusters,
    DNS, firewalls, load balancers, IAM, storage, logging, and performance
    monitoring, often spanning private, public, and hybrid cloud architectures.


    In this workshop, Paul Stack and Mikhail Shilkov show you how to tackle these challenges using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through a series of hands-on labs. The techniques work for any cloud --- Azure, AWS, and GCP. You'll be able to leverage your favorite languages including Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C# instead of YAML or domain-specific languages.


    After completing this workshop, you'll be up and running with IaC fundamentals, modern application architectures across many clouds, and Kubernetes best-practices that are ready for production environments. You'll also be ready to empower your development teams to be more productive --- continuously deploying both their applications and infrastructure.
