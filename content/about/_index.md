    - title: Dream Big
      content: We can’t possibly succeed at our audacious mission by taking small, conservative steps. Instead, we are lifelong learners who are intellectually curious, creative, rebellious, and like to dream big. We hire the best and the brightest, imagine a better future together, and empower our employees to invent the future.

    - title: Play to Win, as a Team
      content: Being a global and inclusive team enables us to build the best products for our customers, and everybody has a seat at the table no matter their background, experiences, or title. We are always raising the bar and maintaining a high level of team performance in our drive to win as a team. We celebrate those wins together, learn from our failures together, and are on this journey as a team together.

    - title: Bias for Action
      content: We make fast decisions, learn from them, and own the outcomes. Good today is better than perfect tomorrow. When in doubt, we empower action, experimentation, learning, and iteration. We strive to build internal consensus so that we are all bought in, but in cases where we disagree, we disagree, commit, and get going!

    - title: Be an Owner
      content: As early employees, we are owners and behave accordingly. We are frugal, spend Pulumi’s resources as if they’re our own, and accomplish more with less.
