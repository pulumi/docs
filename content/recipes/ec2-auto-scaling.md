faq:
  - question: What is the difference between launch templates and launch configurations?
    answer: Launch templates are the newer, recommended approach. They support all the latest EC2 features including T2/T3 unlimited mode, spot instances, and more instance types. Launch configurations are deprecated and lack these features. Always use launch templates for new deployments.
  - question: How does Auto Scaling maintain high availability?
    answer: Auto Scaling continuously monitors the health of instances. When an instance fails health checks, Auto Scaling automatically terminates it and launches a replacement to maintain your desired capacity. Distributing instances across multiple availability zones provides additional resilience.
  - question: What is the cooldown period and why does it matter?
    answer: The cooldown period (default 300 seconds) is the time between scaling activities. It prevents Auto Scaling from launching or terminating instances too quickly when metrics fluctuate. Adjust this based on your application's startup time - longer for slow-starting apps.
  - question: How do I add scaling policies to respond to load?
    answer: Use aws.autoscaling.Policy resources to define target tracking or step scaling policies. Target tracking (recommended) automatically adjusts capacity to maintain a metric like CPU utilization at 70%. This example shows the basic group; scaling policies are added separately.
  - question: Can I use Auto Scaling with a load balancer?
    answer: Yes, and it's recommended for production. Attach your Auto Scaling Group to an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across healthy instances, and you can configure health checks to let Auto Scaling know when to replace unhealthy instances.

## How do I auto-scale EC2 instances with AWS Auto Scaling Groups?

**To automatically scale EC2 instances based on demand**, create an Auto Scaling Group with a launch template that defines your instance configuration. Auto Scaling maintains your desired capacity, replaces unhealthy instances, and can scale up or down in response to load. The following example shows how to set up basic auto-scaling in TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, and Java.

```typescript
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";

const example = new aws.ec2.LaunchTemplate("example", {
    namePrefix: "example",
    imageId: exampleAwsAmi.id,
    instanceType: "c5.large",
});

const exampleGroup = new aws.autoscaling.Group("example", {
    availabilityZones: ["us-east-1a"],
    desiredCapacity: 1,
    maxSize: 1,
    minSize: 1,
    launchTemplate: {
        id: example.id,
        version: "$Latest",
    },
});

## Key configuration details

**Launch template**: Defines the instance configuration including AMI, instance type, security groups, and user data. Using `namePrefix` instead of `name` allows AWS to generate unique names when creating new versions.

**Desired capacity**: The number of instances Auto Scaling attempts to maintain. Auto Scaling replaces failed instances to maintain this count. Set this based on your baseline load.

**Min and max size**: Define the boundaries for scaling. `minSize` ensures you always have at least this many instances running. `maxSize` prevents runaway scaling costs.

**Availability zones**: Specifies which zones to launch instances in. For production, use multiple zones (e.g., `["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]`) to ensure high availability across zone failures.

**Launch template version**: Using `$Latest` always launches instances with the most recent template version. You can specify a specific version number for more control over deployments.

**Health checks**: By default, Auto Scaling uses EC2 status checks. For applications behind load balancers, add `healthCheckType: "ELB"` to use load balancer health checks instead.

**Scaling policies not included**: This example creates a static group. Add scaling policies separately to automatically adjust capacity based on metrics like CPU utilization or request count.
