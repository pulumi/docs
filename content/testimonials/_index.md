      message: "Why is \n@PulumiCorp\n so good, absolute minimum you can replicate everything you can do with other tools but that's just the start. If your #IaC is proper code you can use other sdks to fill gaps and it can be seamless. Used sdk to get secrets to pass to Pulumi, just worked üòç"

      message: "Continuing on my thread about @PulumiCorp from a while ago: holy **** I am a convert. I needed to setup a staging environment that was mostly identical to prod, and once I trued up our Pulumi stack with AWS, it took minutes to do this. How have I lived without this until now?"

      message: "I'm a big fan so far! Love being able to work in C# instead of yaml. Type safety, intellisense, class abstractions, etc all feel great.\n\nI was using it for allowing for a quick setup of Keycloak on a local box that clones down my repo aand did run into a weird snag with setting up scopes, but not pulumi based as far as I can tell!\n\nRegardless, it's been pretty fun and I'm not even an infra guy"

I've been doing a POC for Confluent Cloud, and I was able to provision and deprovision an environment+cluster+api-keys, and then launch my application as a local.Command, all in a single 50 line python script and in a single day.

      message: "Seriously, this is the first time I''ve looked at a framework that I could possibly use for DevOps and actually thought it might be worth the investment. My tiny company cannot afford to invest a lot of time learning something new that does not have an immediate benefit. Yours is the first framework I might actually invest the time in. The idea of having all the code in one place - the code for the infrastructure and the apps running on it - is very appealing."

      message: "I've loved Pulumi so far - doing some early testing before doing a small in-house deployment, then I'll be able to encourage adoption of Pulumi across our new business unit, then perhaps across the whole of our org - we'll see. \n\nI love the model of Pulumi, being able to use it mainly as a library, from different languages, and I'm looking forward to using the automation API. Great work all round :)"

If you could provide one place for your fans that would be great. I would like to become a follower, provide a 5 star rating on platforms like Product Hunt, etc. Let me know how I could help."

      message: "I love it!\n\nI came from about 3 years of terraform + kube + aws. The kubernetes & helm support in Pulumi is amazing, it fixes most of the jank i had with terraform at scale. Just being able to spin up a cluster and install addons and extras cleanly (no external kubectl with un-tracked resources) is life-changing. Also things like being able to change the version in a helm chart and see the actual resource diffs properly.\n\nIt seemed pretty clear to me that your team actually tried to _use_ the kube support, and cared about how well it worked, vs $other_vendor.\n\nThanks for an amazing tool."

      message: "Just wanted to send a quick message and let you know I've been playing around a bit with the pulumi AI tool. So far, its been fantastic. There are many pieces of configuration that I know need to be done but I sometimes can't remember the syntax or perhaps the methods to use to accomplish what I know that I need. Using the AI tool for basic/simple questions sped up my development process. One example I can provide is setting up my new EKS cluster. Going through this process I know that I will need to modify the aws-auth configmap to provide various levels of access to users mapped to AWS roles. However, I didn't remember how to accomplish this using Pulumi. Simple question to the AI and it was able to provide me with the base framework that I can then build off of to suit my use case."

      The only criticism I have is that I hadn't come across your platform before. Perhaps there's an opportunity to enhance your marketing efforts."
