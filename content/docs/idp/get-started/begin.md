Before you get started using Pulumi IDP, let's run through a few quick steps to ensure your environment is set up correctly.

Pulumi IDP is in public preview and is free for Pulumi customers and community members to use. General availability and enterprise pricing will follow later this year. Some IDP aspects depend on paid features, like organization templates.

### Create a Pulumi account

Pulumi IDP is a service of Pulumi Cloud, meaning you will need to create a Pulumi account to be able to use it. To do so, navigate to the [Pulumi Cloud console](https://app.pulumi.com) and create a new account. Once created, you can [optionally create an access token](/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/access-tokens/). Doing so will provide you an alternative way to sign into the Pulumi Cloud via the CLI. The token can also be used to automate your usage of the Pulumi Cloud using the REST API.
