    Pulumi IDP (Internal Developer Platform) gives platform teams the ability to build secure, compliant, and customizable golden paths for provisioning infrastructure. It uses a bottom-up approach, ensuring best practices are codified from the start. 
    
    Platform teams define building blocks using components and templates, enabling developers to provision infrastructure in the way that best suits them. Developers can leverage components when writing Pulumi programs in their preferred programming language, scaffold components using low-code YAML templates, or deploy no-code programs from the Pulumi console.
