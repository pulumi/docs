This section provides proven patterns and ready-to-use blueprints that help you implement well-architected solutions with Pulumi IDP. These resources follow industry best practices and have been validated in production environments.

## Patterns

Common architectural patterns and design approaches for organizing your infrastructure code and workflows:

- [IDP Pattern: One ESC environment per service](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/one-esc-environment-per-service)
- [IDP Pattern: One ESC environment per team](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/one-esc-environment-per-team)
- [IDP Pattern: One ESC environment per lifecycle stage](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/one-esc-environment-per-lifecycle-stage)
- [IDP Pattern: Composable environments](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/composable-environments)
- [IDP Pattern: Container-based apps, centrally managed container infra](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/container-based-apps-centrally-managed-infra)
- [IDP Pattern: Policies as tests](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/policies-as-tests)
- [IDP Pattern: Components using other Components](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/components-using-other-components)
- [IDP Pattern: Validating Component Inputs using Policy functions](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/validating-component-inputs-using-policy-functions)
- [IDP Pattern: Cost control using Components, Policies, and constrained inputs](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/cost-control-using-components-policies-constrained-inputs)
- [IDP Pattern: Security Updates using Components](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/security-updates-using-components)

## Blueprints

Ready-to-use examples and reference implementations for common use cases.

Coming soon: Comprehensive blueprints that combine multiple patterns into complete solutions for specific scenarios.
