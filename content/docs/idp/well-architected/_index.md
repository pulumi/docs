This section provides proven patterns and foundational frameworks that help you implement well-architected solutions with Pulumi IDP. These resources follow industry best practices and have been validated in production environments.

## Core Concepts

Learn the foundational approach for building with Pulumi IDP:

- [Four Factors: Templates, Components, Environments, and Policies](/docs/idp/well-architected/four-factors)

## Patterns

Common architectural patterns and design approaches for organizing your infrastructure code and workflows:

- [IDP Pattern: One ESC environment per service](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/one-esc-environment-per-service)
- [IDP Pattern: One ESC environment per team](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/one-esc-environment-per-team)
- [IDP Pattern: One ESC environment per lifecycle stage](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/one-esc-environment-per-lifecycle-stage)
- [IDP Pattern: Composable environments](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/composable-environments)
- [IDP Pattern: Multiple workloads on shared infrastructure](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/multiple-workloads-shared-infrastructure)
- [IDP Pattern: Policies as tests](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/policies-as-tests)
- [IDP Pattern: Components using other Components](/docs/idp/well-architected/patterns/components-using-other-components)
