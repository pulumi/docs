    Pulumi Neo is an AI agent that enables platform engineers to make natural language requests for routine tasks, analysis, and infrastructure management. Rather than writing code or running CLI commands for every operation, you can describe what you need and let Neo handle the implementation.

    Neo works across your entire infrastructure, understanding dependencies and creating execution plans that go through pull requests for review, ensuring human oversight while automating complex multi-step workflows.
