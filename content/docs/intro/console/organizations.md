An organization is the primary grouping unit for stacks within the Pulumi Console.
When you sign into the Pulumi Console, a personal account is automatically
created for you and subscribed to the Pulumi Community plan.

You can however be a member of multiple Pulumi organizations, and collaborate
with other developers.

If you're a Pulumi organization admin, you have the
ability to:

* [Invite users]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/organization-roles#organization-membership" >}})
* Manage default stack permissions for the organization
* [Create teams]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/teams#creating-a-team" >}}) and manage their permissions
* Assign [organization roles]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/organization-roles" >}}) for role-based access control (RBAC)
to your organization's stacks

## Creating a New Organization

You can create a new Pulumi organization directly from the Pulumi Console.

## Organization Types

A Pulumi organization needs to be linked to a third-party identity provider, offering an
additional layer
of security for you and your team. While membership within the Pulumi organization is
managed by
an organization admin, you must be a member of the backing third-party identity
provider in order
to join a Pulumi organization.

For example, if a Pulumi organization, `https://app.pulumi.com/robot-co`, is backed by
a GitHub organization,
`https://github.com/robot-co`, then only members of `https://github.com/robot-co` may be
added to `https://app.pulumi.com/robot-co`.
Similarly, as soon as someone loses access to the GitHub organization, they will no
longer have access to the Pulumi organization it is backing.

The following table shows the relationship between a Pulumi organization and third-party
groupings.

| Pulumi | GitHub | GitLab | Bitbucket |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Organization | [Organization](https://github.com/collab-uniba/socialcde4eclipse/wiki/How-to-setup-a-GitHub-organization,-project-and-team) | [Group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/group/)| [Workspace](https://bitbucket.org/blog/introducing-workspaces) |

In addition, a Pulumi organization may be backed by a [SAML 2.0 identity provider]({{<
relref "/docs/guides/saml" >}}).

### GitHub-backed

To add a GitHub-backed organization to Pulumi, an admin of the GitHub organization
must
first grant the Pulumi OAuth app the `read:org` scope. This can be done on GitHub's
[Applications
page](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/7cf9078f3c92b17a5f0f).

Pulumi requires the [`read:org`
scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/#available-scopes)
in order to verify memberships within the GitHub organization. The Pulumi Console
will not have access to any of the organization's source code, issues, or other data.

### GitLab-backed

To add a GitLab-backed organization to Pulumi, an admin of the GitLab group
may add the group to Pulumi, and invite its members to join Pulumi.

GitLab allows group admins to add members with a temporary membership, i.e., with an
expiration value. In order to invite
those members to Pulumi, their membership in the GitLab group must still be active. As
soon as their
GitLab group membership expires, those users will lose access to the GitLab-backed
organization on Pulumi.

### Bitbucket-backed

To add a Bitbucket-backed organization to Pulumi, an admin of the Atlassian
Bitbucket workspace
must first grant the Pulumi Oauth app [read
access](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud-238027431.html#OAuthonBitbucketCloud-Scopes)
to their Bitbucket account and workspace membership information.

Once the Pulumi organization has been created, the admin can see a list of Bitbucket workspace
members
that they can add or invite to the Pulumi organization. See [Switching
Organizations](#switching-organizations)
to learn more.

## SAML Single Sign-on (SSO)

The Pulumi Enterprise edition provides more options for identity and access, including
support for
any SAML 2.0-based identity provider.

[Learn more]({{< relref "/docs/guides/saml" >}}) about configuring a SAML-based
organization on Pulumi. Or refer to one
of our guides:

* [Azure Active Directory]({{< relref "/docs/guides/saml/aad" >}})
* [G Suite]({{< relref "/docs/guides/saml/gsuite" >}})
* [Okta]({{< relref "/docs/guides/saml/okta" >}})

If you need help configuring or would like us to officially support another SAML identity
provider,
please [contact us]({{< relref "/about#contact-us" >}}).

## Switching Organizations

The Organization drop-down list displays all of the organizations your account is
associated with, and lets you add a new organization backed by a third
party identity provider. To switch to a different organization:

1. Select the organization drop-down list in the upper left corner of the Console screen
next to the Pulumi logo.
1. Select your organization name. The organization page view is dependent on your role within the Pulumi organization.
