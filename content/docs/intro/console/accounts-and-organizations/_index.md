## Product Editions

To learn about Pulumi's different subscription plans, see [Pulumi Product Editions]({{< relref "editions" >}}).

## Accounts

Create a [Pulumi user account]({{< relref "accounts" >}}) for free by signing into the
Pulumi Console with one of the provided identity options. This is how you will authenticate
into the Console, until you [add new identities]({{< relref "accounts/#adding-new-identities" >}})
including one from your [SAML 2.0 provider]({{< relref "/docs/guides/saml" >}}).

## Organizations

When you create an account, an organization that is subscribed to [the Community
Edition]({{< relref "editions#community-edition" >}}) gets created with it. Start creating and
managing your stacks with it, or create a new
[Pulumi Organization]({{< relref "organizations" >}}) to collaborate with your team.
