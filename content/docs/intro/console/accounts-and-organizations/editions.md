Pulumi has multiple subscription plans available to organizations, each offering an
expanding set of features and capabilities.

## Pulumi Community Edition{#community-edition}

When you sign into the Pulumi Console, an individual organization is automatically
created for your account and subscribed to the Pulumi Community edition. The Pulumi
Community Edition is free forever for unlimited individual use.

With your Community Edition organization, you can create an unlimited number of stacks,
encrypt configuration and resource secrets, and browse stack history.

But if you want to collaborate with other developers or use advanced features such as ones
that require [SAML SSO]({{< relref "/docs/guides/saml" >}}), you'll need to create a new Pulumi
organization.

## Other Editions

**Pulumi Team Starter** is ideal for teams just getting started deploying cloud
applications and infrastructure.

**Pulumi Team Pro** is ideal for medium to large teams using Pulumi for multiple projects
or clouds.

**Pulumi Enterprise Edition** is ideal for large organizations running cloud software at
scale,
with advanced or custom needs.

For more information about the specific differences and capabilities offered for the
