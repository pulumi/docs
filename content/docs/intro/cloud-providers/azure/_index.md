The native Azure provider for Pulumi can be used to provision any of the cloud resources available in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) via Azure Resource Manager (ARM). The Azure provider must be configured with credentials to deploy and update resources in Azure.

See the [full API documentation]({{< relref "/docs/reference/pkg/azure-native" >}}) for complete details of the available Azure provider APIs.

## Setup

The native Azure provider supports several options for providing access to Azure credentials.  See [Azure setup page]({{< relref "/docs/intro/cloud-providers/azure/setup" >}}) for details.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started with Azure is to follow the [Get Started]({{< relref "/docs/get-started/azure" >}}) guide.

From there, you can dive deeper with additional Azure examples:

* [Azure Function Apps](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-functions): Create a serverless function
* [Azure AppService with SQL and AppInsights](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-appservice): Build an AppService web application that uses SQL and AppInsights
* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-aks): Create an AKS cluster
* [Azure Container Instances](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-aci): Deploy a web app to Azure Container Intances

## Migration

The differences between the classic Azure provider and the native Azure provider and the process of migration are outlined in the [Migration Guide]({{< relref "./from-classic" >}}) guide.

If you are migrating from Azure Resource Manager templates, read our [Migrate From Azure Resource Manager]({{< relref "/docs/guides/adopting/from_azure" >}}) guide.

## Example

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```typescript
import * as resources from "@pulumi/azure-native/resources";

const resourceGroup = new resources.ResourceGroup("resourceGroup");
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```python
import pulumi_azure_native as azure_native

resource_group = azure_native.resources.ResourceGroup("resourceGroup")
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```csharp
using Pulumi;
using Pulumi.AzureNative.Resources;

class MyStack : Stack
{
    public MyStack()
    {
        var resourceGroup = new ResourceGroup("resourceGroup");
    }

}

class Program
{
    static Task<int> Main(string[] args) => Deployment.RunAsync<MyStack>();
}
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-native/sdk/go/azure/resources"
    "github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/v2/go/pulumi"
)

func main() {
    pulumi.Run(func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
        _, err := resources.NewResourceGroup(ctx, "resourceGroup", nil)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        return nil
    })
}
```

The native Azure provider SDKs are open source and available in the [pulumi/pulumi-azure-native](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-native) repo.

## Configuration

The native Azure provider accepts the following configuration settings. These can be provided via `pulumi config set azure-native:<option>`, or passed to the constructor of [Provider]({{< relref "/docs/reference/pkg/azure-native/provider" >}}) to construct a specific instance of the Azure provider.

* `auxiliaryTenantIds`: (Optional) It can also be sourced from the following environment variable: ARM_AUXILIARY_TENANT_IDS
* `clientCertificatePassword`: (Optional) The password associated with the Client Certificate. For use when authenticating as a Service Principal using a Client Certificate It can also be sourced from the following environment variable: ARM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
* `clientCertificatePath`: (Optional) The path to the Client Certificate associated with the Service Principal for use when authenticating as a Service Principal using a Client Certificate. It can also be sourced from the following environment variable: ARM_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH
* `clientId`: (Optional) The Client ID which should be used. It can also be sourced from the following environment variable: ARM_CLIENT_ID
* `clientSecret`: (Optional) The Client Secret which should be used. For use When authenticating as a Service Principal using a Client Secret. It can also be sourced from the following environment variable: ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
