meta_desc: This page provides an overview on how to configure the Pulumi Spotinst Provider.

The [Pulumi Spotinst provider]({{< relref "./" >}}) uses the Spotinst SDK to manage resources.

> Pulumi relies on the Spotinst SDK to authenticate requests from your computer to Spotinst. Your credentials are never sent

### Configuring The Provider

Once obtained, there are two ways to communicate your configuration tokens to Pulumi:

1. Set the environment variables `SPOTINST_ACCOUNT` and `SPOTINST_ACCOUNT`:

    ```bash
    $ export SPOTINST_ACCOUNT=XXXXXX
    $ export SPOTINST_TOKEN=YYYYYY
    ```

2. Set them using configuration, if you prefer that they be stored alongside your Pulumi stack for easy multi-user access:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set spotinst:account XXXXXX
    $ pulumi config set spotinst:token --secret
    ```

Remember to pass `--secret` when setting `token` so that it is properly encrypted.
