## State

Pulumi stores its own copy of the current state of your infrastructure. This is
often simply called _state_, and is stored in transactional snapshots we call
_checkpoints_. A _checkpoint_ is recorded by Pulumi at various points so that
it can operate reliably---whether that means diffing goal state versus
current state during an update, recovering from failure, or destroying
resources accurately to clean up afterwards. Because _state_ is critical to how
Pulumi operates, we'll cover a few of the state backend options on this page.

## Backends

Pulumi supports multiple  _backends_ for storing your infrastructure
state:

- The Pulumi Service backend
- A self-managed backend, either stored locally on your filesystem or remotely using
a cloud storage service

### Pulumi Service backend

The Pulumi Service backend requires no additional configuration after
[installing the CLI]({{< relref "/docs/get-started/install" >}}). By default, the CLI
uses the Service backend hosted at [app.pulumi.com](https://app.pulumi.com).

Pulumi offers this backend as a free service with
[advanced tiers]({{< relref "/pricing" >}}) for team and
enterprise features. Using the [Pulumi Service backend](#pulumi-backend-features)
and the CLI together provides a great combination of usability, safety, and
security for most users.

However, if you would prefer to manage this yourself, you can do so by opting
into the filesystem or cloud storage backend.

### Self-managed backend

To use the [filesystem or local](#filesystem-or-local) option,
run `pulumi login --local` so Pulumi stores your _checkpoint_ files locally
on your machine. The default directory for these JSON files is
`~/.pulumi`.

To use the [cloud storage or remote](#cloud-storage-or-remote) option, run
`pulumi login --cloud-url <your-cloud-storage-url>` so Pulumi stores
your _checkpoint_ files at your specified URL
for your cloud storage object, also in a `.pulumi` directory. For
example,
`https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/<my-pulumi-state-bucket>/.pulumi`
where `<my-pulumi-state-bucket>` is the name
of your S3 bucket.

Visit the following links for details on cloud provider
CLI and storage setup:

- **AWS S3.** _See [AWS Setup]({{< relref "/docs/intro/cloud-providers/aws/setup" >}})
and [Working with Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html)._
- **Azure Blob.** _See [Azure Setup]({{< relref "/docs/intro/cloud-providers/azure/setup" >}})
and Microsoft's [Storage Blobs Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli)._
- **Google Cloud Storage.** _See [GCP Setup]({{< relref "/docs/intro/cloud-providers/gcp/setup" >}})
and [Google's Cloud Storage Quickstarts](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/quickstarts)._

### Pulumi Service backend features

At a glance, the Pulumi Service backend provides the following benefits:

- Secure checkpoint storage, with client-side authentication to your cloud provider
- Encrypted state in transit and at rest
- Full deployment history for auditing and rollback purposes
- Concurrent state locking to prevent corrupting your infrastructure state in a team environment
- Advanced policy and RBAC (Role Based Access Control)

## Logging in

The `pulumi login` <a href="{{< relref "/docs/reference/cli/pulumi_login" >}}"
target="_blank">CLI command</a> lets you log in to a backend. By default,
you will be prompted to log in anytime you try to do something that requires stacks or state.

### Backend info check

To quickly check your backend login info, run `pulumi whoami` with the `v` or verbose flag.

```bash
$ pulumi whoami -v
```

See [pulumi whoami]({{< relref "/docs/reference/cli/pulumi_whoami" >}}) for more details.

#### Example response

```
User: <your-username>
Backend URL: https://app.pulumi.com/<your-username>
```

### To the Pulumi Service backend

The Pulumi Service backend login process involves using access tokens.

```sh
$ pulumi login
```

The prompt looks like the following:

```
Manage your Pulumi stacks by logging in.  Run `pulumi
login --help` for alternative login options.  Enter your access token from
https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens or hit <ENTER> to log in using your
browser            :
```

If you hit `<ENTER>` as instructed, a web browser _should_ pop up, and will
interact with the service to generate a new access token. If this is your first
time using the service, you will need to authenticate.

To view your generated tokens, or create a new one, visit <a
href="https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens"
target="_blank">app.pulumi.com/account/tokens</a>.  The **Access Tokens** page
displays a list of past tokens, when they were last used, and gives you the
option to revoke them.

<img src="/images/docs/reference/state_tokens.png" alt="Pulumi.com Tokens Page"
class="img-bordered">

After logging in, _state_ will automatically get persisted with the service.
From time to time, you will see a helpful URL to your update or stack pages.
You can always go there to see a full history of updates.

To log in to a privately hosted version of Pulumi Enterprise, simply pass its
URL to the command:

```sh
$ pulumi login https://pulumi.acmecorp.com
```

Everything else works the same, except that Pulumi will target your private
service instead of `app.pulumi.com`.

### To a self-managed backend

The filesystem or cloud storage backend allows you to store state locally on
your machine, or remotely with your cloud storage provider. For self-managed backends,
state management including backup, sharing, and team access synchronization is
entirely up to you. Pulumi built the Pulumi Service backend to solve all of these
problems "out of the box", but we understand that some users prefer to have
more control.

#### Filesystem or local

To use the filesystem backend instead, simply pass the `--local` flag when
logging in:

```sh
$ pulumi login --local
```

You should see `Logged into <my-machine> as <my-user> (file://~)` as a result
where `<my-machine>` and `<my-user>` are your configured machine and user names
respectively. This stores all stack checkpoints as JSON files to`/home/.pulumi`
directory on your machine.

To control where these checkpoints get stored, you may specify
a `file://<path>` URL instead, where `<path>` is the full path to the target
directory where _checkpoint_ files will get stored. For instance, to store
state underneath `/app/data/.pulumi/` instead, you can run this command:

```sh
$ pulumi login file:///app/data
```

> **Note:** If you use a relative path (e.g. `file://./einstein`), Pulumi will
> always make it relative to ***the current working directory.***

Notice that `pulumi login --local` is simply syntactic sugar for `pulumi login
file://~`.

#### Cloud storage or remote

To use a remote backend instead with your preferred cloud storage provider,
simply pass the `--cloud-url` or `-c` flag and your storage bucket or blob URL
when logging in:

```sh
$ pulumi login --cloud-url s3://my-pulumi-state-bucket
```

You should see `Logged into <my-machine> as <my-user>
(s3://my-pulumi-state-bucket)` where `<my-machine>` and `<my-user>` are your
configured machine and user names respectively.

In the previous example, we passed an AWS S3 bucket URL, but you can also use
Google Cloud or Azure Blob storage.

##### Amazon S3

```
pulumi login --cloud-url s3://my-pulumi-state-bucket
```

##### Google Cloud Storage

```
pulumi login --cloud-url gs://my-pulumi-state-bucket
```

##### Azure Blob Storage

```
pulumi login --cloud-url azblob://my-pulumi-state-bucket
```

This stores all stack checkpoints as JSON files to the `.pulumi` directory of
your specified cloud URL.

To control where these checkpoints get stored, refer to your cloud storage
provider's documentation. See [Self-managed backend](#self-managed-backend)
for quick links to Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Azure's storage service quickstarts.

You may omit `--cloud-url` or `-c` when logging in to a remote backend and just
use `pulumi login s3://my-pulumi-state-bucket`.

The precise JSON format these checkpoint files use is not documented, but is
defined in the [APIType source code](
https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/pkg/apitype/) if you'd like to
understand their contents. Note that this is the same JSON format used by the
`pulumi stack export` and `pulumi stack import` commands.

#### Notes on self-managed backends

If you lose the checkpoint for your stack, Pulumi will be unable to manage any
existing resources. Additionally, since Pulumi thinks your stack is empty,
Pulumi will attempt to recreate all of the resources in your stack the next
time you run `pulumi up`.

Some commands may behave slightly differently when using the local or remote
storage endpoint. For example, when connected to `pulumi.com`, `pulumi up`
ensures there are no other updates in flight for a given stack. This doesn't
happen with self-managed backends. Pulumi also manages secrets using a key
encrypted with a passphrase and stored in `Pulumi.<stack-name>.yaml`. This
requires you enter the passphrase when you `preview`, `update`, or `delete`
your stack. If you want to collaborate with another person, you'll need to
share this passphrase with them as well. All of these overhead tasks will have
to be managed separately when you opt into the local or remote state backend.

### Going back to the Pulumi Service backend

If you are currently using a self-managed backend, but would now prefer to
simplify things, just run `pulumi login`again, and you’ll be back to
using `app.pulumi.com`.

> **Note:** Existing stacks on a self-managed backend have to be migrated. It's
> easiest to just plan on recreating them.
>
> In addition, if you have any encrypted configuration in your stack, you'll
> need to rerun
`pulumi config set --secret <key> <value>` because `pulumi.com` uses
a different key to encrypt your secrets than the local endpoint.

If you'd like to migrate your stacks from the filesystem to the Pulumi Service
backend, you can follow the steps below. Suppose the stack "my-app-production"
has been managed with a local checkpoint file, and you want to migrate it to
the Pulumi Service. Run the following commands if you are logged in to the local
endpoint:

```sh
$ pulumi stack select my-app-production # switch to the stack we want to export
$ pulumi stack export --file my-app-production.checkpoint.json # export the stack's checkpoint to a local file
$ pulumi login
$ pulumi stack init my-app-production # create a new stack with the same name on pulumi.com
$ pulumi stack import --file my-app-production.checkpoint.json # import the new existing checkpoint into pulumi.com
```

To migrate from a remote backend, you will have to download the checkpoint
files stored in the `.pulumi` directory of your cloud storage URL.

### Secrets Encryption

When a secret value is provided via secret configuration---either by passing
`--secret` to `pulumi config set`, or by creating one inside your program via
`pulumi.secret` (JavaScript) or `Output.secret` (Python)---the value is
encrypted with a key managed by the backend you are connected to.  When using
the local or remote backend, this key is derived from a passphrase you set when
creating your stack. When using the Pulumi Service backend, it is handled by
a key managed by the service.

For new stacks managed with the Pulumi Service backend, you may choose to use the
passphrase-based key instead. Pass `--secrets-provider passphrase` when you
create the stack---either via `pulumi new` or `pulumi stack init`. You will be
prompted to choose a passphrase which will be required for future operations
like `update`, `preview`, and `destroy`.

When using the filesystem or cloud storage backend, you must use the
passphrase-based secrets provider.

## Logging out

To delete stored credentials on your machine and log out from your current
backend, run `pulumi logout`. See [pulumi logout]({{< relref "/docs/reference/cli/pulumi_logout" >}})
for more details.
