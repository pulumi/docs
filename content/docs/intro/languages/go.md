Pulumi supports writing your infrastructure as code using the Go language. Go 1.14 or later is required.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get up and running is to choose from one of the following Getting Started guides:

<div class="tiles my-4">
    <a class="tile flex-1 p-4" href="{{< relref "/docs/get-started/aws" >}}">
        <img class="h-8 mx-auto" src="/logos/tech/aws.svg" alt="AWS">
    </a>
    <a class="tile md:mx-4 flex-1 p-4" href="{{< relref "/docs/get-started/azure" >}}">
        <img class="h-8 mx-auto" src="/logos/tech/azure.svg" alt="Azure">
    </a>
    <a class="tile flex-1 p-4" href="{{< relref "/docs/get-started/gcp" >}}">
        <img class="h-8 mx-auto" src="/logos/tech/gcp.svg" alt="Google Cloud">
    </a>
</div>

## Templates

The fastest way to get started is to use a template. The template will initialize a Pulumi project. The getting started guides shown above will help do this on your cloud of choice, but this section describes doing so independently.

From an empty directory, create a new project:

```bash
$ mkdir myproject && cd myproject
$ pulumi new go
```

This will create a `Pulumi.yaml` [project file]({{< relref "../concepts/project" >}}) containing some minimal metadata about your project (including a name and description which you may wish to change) and a `main.go` file containing your program. The name of the directory is used as the project name in `Pulumi.yaml`. Use your favorite Go dependency manager (such as Go's built-in modules system, by running `go mod init` in your project's directory).

To deploy your infrastructure, first build your Go program: `go build -o $(basename $(pwd))`. Then run `pulumi up` and Pulumi will perform the operations needed to deploy the infrastructure you have declared.

This `go` template is cloud agnostic, and you will need to install additional Go modules for the cloud provider of your choice. Additional templates are available that do this for you:

* `pulumi new aws-go`: creates a starter AWS Go project
* `pulumi new azure-go`: creates a starter Azure Go project
* `pulumi new gcp-go`: creates a starter Google Cloud Go project
