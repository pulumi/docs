Pulumi supports programs written in Python 3. Python version 3.6 or later is required.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started with Pulumi Python is by using a template.  From an empty directory in which you'd like to create a new project:

```bash
$ mkdir myproject && cd myproject
$ pulumi new python
```

This creates a `Pulumi.yaml` file, containing minimal metadata about your project (including a name and description, which you may wish to change), a `requirements.txt` file, where you will specify your dependencies (see [Using Pulumi PyPI Packages](#pypi-packages) below), and a `__main__.py` file, containing your program.

Although the template uses a very simple package structure, by placing `__main__.py` in the root directory, Pulumi fully supports [properly modularized Python programs](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/) and `setup.py` files.  This is important if you ever decide to turn your Pulumi program into a library.

Pulumi looks for a `python3` executable to use on `PATH`. If not found, it looks for a `python` executable. It expects the executable it finds to refer to Python 3.6 or above. This can be overridden by explicitly setting the `PULUMI_PYTHON_CMD` environment variable to the name of the Python executable to use.

## Using Pulumi PyPI Packages {#pypi-packages}

### Virtual Environments

It is not required, but we recommend using a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies of your projects and ensure reproducibility between machines.

As of Pulumi 2.4.0, new Python projects created with `pulumi new` will have a virtual environment created in a `venv` directory with required dependencies from `requirements.txt` installed in it, and Pulumi will automatically use this virtual environment when running the program.

This behavior is controlled by the following `virtualenv` `runtime` option in `Pulumi.yaml`:

```yaml
runtime:
  name: python
  options:
    virtualenv: venv
```

`virtualenv` is the path to a virtual environment to use.

Existing Python projects can opt-in to using the built-in virtual environment support by setting the `virtualenv` option. To manually create a virtual environment and install dependencies, run the following commands in your project directory:

{{< chooser os "macos,windows,linux" >}}

{{% choosable os macos %}}

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable os linux %}}

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable os windows %}}

```bat
> python -m venv venv
> venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{< /chooser >}}

If you prefer to manage the virtual environment on your own (for example, using tools like [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)), you can delete the local `venv` directory and unset the `virtualenv` option in `Pulumi.yaml`:

```yaml
runtime: python
```

When managing the virtual environment on your own, you'll need to run any `pulumi` commands (such as `pulumi up`) from an activated virtual environment shell (or, if using a tool like [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), prefix any `pulumi` commands with `pipenv run pulumi ...`).

### Adding a new dependency {#packages}

There are many available Pulumi Python [packages]({{< relref "/docs/reference/pkg" >}}).

To install a new dependency in the virtual environment, add an entry to `requirements.txt`, and run the following in your project directory:

{{< chooser os "macos,windows,linux" >}}

{{% choosable os macos %}}

```bash
$ venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable os linux %}}

```bash
$ venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable os windows %}}

```bat
> python -m venv venv
> venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{< /chooser >}}
