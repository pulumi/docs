Pulumi is a multi-language runtime. Your choice of language does not affect which
clouds may be targeted. Each language is just as
capable as the other and supports the entire surface area of resources available.

The following language runtimes are currently supported by Pulumi:

* [Node.js]({{< relref "javascript.md" >}}) - JavaScript, TypeScript, or any other Node.js compatible language
* [Python 3]({{< relref "python.md" >}}) - Python 3.6 or greater
* [.NET]({{< relrf "dotnet.md" >}}) - .NET 
* Go <span class="badge badge-preview">PREVIEW</span> - statically compiled Go binaries (*documentation coming soon*)


If your favorite language isn't listed, it may be on its way soon. Pulumi is [open
source](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi), and it is possible [to add your own
language]({{< relref "/docs/troubleshooting/faq.md#how-can-i-add-support-for-my-favorite-language" >}}).  For
further questions, [contact us]({{< relref "/docs/troubleshooting/_index.md#contact-us" >}}) and let us
know what you're looking for.
