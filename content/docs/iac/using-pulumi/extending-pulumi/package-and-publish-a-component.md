Create new page titled "Package and Publish a Component".

Location in docs menu: Pulumi IaC-> Using Pulumi-> Extending Pulumi -> Package and Publish a Component

Notes:

Covers packaging and publishing a component for reuse/sharing (reference "Build a Component" page), discusses limitations (works with existing provider resources, vs net-new creation of resource types and should not have external side-effects directly… e.g. how packaged components are NOT providers, and when you’d need a provider instead)
Base this on Mikhail’s comp-as-comp demo.
Add section on migrating from legacy MLCs (or maybe this should be a separate doc, and just linked to from here)
