: implement the "file" provider example in all (?) languages.

: packaging and publishing
: considerations, gotchas, and FAQs

Notes:

Covers creating a packaged provider (aka native provider) in various authoring languages, generating sdks for various target languages, packaging, publishing, and how to use the package, discuss limitations in each language choosable as needed
Based this on file provider example (or maybe there's something better to show?) -->
