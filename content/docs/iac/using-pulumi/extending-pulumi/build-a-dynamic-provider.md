TODO: Write this page

<!-- Create new page titled "Build a Dynamic Provider".

Location in docs menu: Pulumi IaC-> Using Pulumi-> Extending Pulumi -> Build a Dynamic Provider

Page IA:
: when to use a dynamic provider + limitations
: what’s needed to implement a dynamic provider?
:: the provider interface in abstract (Create, Diff, Update, etc)
:: configuration, secrets, outputs, and state
:: how a dynamic provider runs
: Implement the “file” provider example in all available languages.
: Considerations, Gotchas, and FAQs
:: (serialization gotchas)

Notes:

Covers creating a dynamic provider that is included w/ your program, serialized, and run in a provider host shim, discusses limitations (languages, reusability,… e.g. how dynamic providers are NOT native providers, and when you’d need a native provider instead)
Consider reusing existing page on dynamic providers, then reduce the scope of that page (which is a similar tutorial) and instead discuss them as a concept and link to this page from there) -->
