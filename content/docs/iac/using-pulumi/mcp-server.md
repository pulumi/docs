The Pulumi Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables AI-powered coding assistants to help you codify cloud architectures and get diffs for infrastructure changes right in your development environment, much in the same way you already do for code changes thanks to Git. This integration ensures that as you build cloud applications, your infrastructure is repeatable and follows best practices and policies, while dramatically reducing context switching and accelerating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) development workflows.

## What is the Pulumi MCP server?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is a specification that allows language models to interact with external tools and data sources in a structured way. Pulumi's MCP server implementation provides AI assistants with the ability to:

- **Query the Pulumi Registry** for resource information, properties, and documentation
- **Execute Pulumi CLI commands** like `pulumi preview`, `pulumi up`, and `pulumi destroy`
- **Access stack outputs** and configuration values
- **Validate infrastructure code** before deployment
- **Catch and autofix IaC policy violations** using Pulumi's policy-as-code capabilities
- **Debug deployment issues** with real-time feedback
- **Interact with [Pulumi Neo](/docs/iac/neo)** for advanced infrastructure tasks

This enables a more intuitive, conversational approach to infrastructure development where you can describe what you want to build in natural language, and the AI assistant can discover resources, generate code, and manage deploymentsâ€”all without leaving your editor.

## Supported AI assistants

3. Click "Enable"

## Available tools

The Pulumi MCP server provides several tools that AI assistants can use to interact with your Pulumi infrastructure:

### Registry tools

- **`pulumi-registry-get-type`** - Get the JSON schema for a specific JSON schema type reference.
- **`pulumi-registry-get-resource`** - Returns information about a Pulumi Registry resource.
- **`pulumi-registry-list-resources`** - List all resource types for a given provider and module.

### CLI tools

- **`pulumi-cli-preview`** - Run `pulumi preview` for a given project and stack.
- **`pulumi-cli-up`** - Run `pulumi up` for a given project and stack.
- **`pulumi-cli-refresh`** - Run `pulumi refresh` for a given project and stack.
- **`pulumi-cli-stack-output`** - Get the output value(s) of a given stack.

### Deployment tools

- **`deploy-to-aws`** - Automatically analyzes your application files and provisions the appropriate AWS resources (S3, Lambda, EC2, etc.) based on what it finds.

## Available prompts

The Pulumi MCP server also provides prompts that AI assistants can use for common workflows:

- **`deploy-to-aws`** - Deploy application code to AWS by generating Pulumi infrastructure
- **`convert-terraform-to-typescript`** - Converts a Terraform file to TypeScript. Takes an optional outputDir parameter for specifying where to output the TypeScript code.

## Getting started

Here's a typical workflow using an AI assistant with the Pulumi MCP server:

### 1. Initialize a new project

Start by asking your AI assistant to help set up a new Pulumi project:

> "Create a new Pulumi project in TypeScript for AWS infrastructure."

The assistant can guide you through project initialization and basic setup.

### 2. Describe your infrastructure needs

Use natural language to describe what you want to build:

> "I need an AWS S3 bucket with public read access for hosting a static website. Please look up the resource properties and create the code."

The AI assistant will:

- Use `pulumi-registry-list-resources` to find available AWS resources
- Use `pulumi-registry-get-resource` to get detailed S3 bucket property information
- Generate the appropriate TypeScript code

### 3. Validate and deploy

Ask the assistant to validate and deploy your infrastructure:

> "Please run a preview to check the changes, then deploy if everything looks good."

The assistant will:

- Use `pulumi-cli-preview` to show planned changes
- Use `pulumi-cli-up` to deploy the infrastructure
- Provide feedback on the deployment status

### 4. Manage and iterate

Continue working conversationally:

> "Add a CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket and export the distribution URL."

The assistant can make incremental changes, validate them, and update your infrastructure.

## Integration with Pulumi Neo

Pulumi MCP server handles basic infrastructure tasks directly, while also allowing you to delegate advanced scenarios to Pulumi Neo, Pulumi's purpose-built infrastructure automation agent. Simply tell your AI assistant to invoke Neo, and it will create a new task that you can complete in the Pulumi Console.

## Examples

### Provisioning an AKS cluster

Here's an example interaction for creating an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster:

**You:** "I have an empty Pulumi project with TypeScript. Please provision an AKS cluster for a temporary experiment. Export its kubeconfig when done."

**AI Assistant response:**

1. Searches the Pulumi Registry for Azure container service resources
2. Retrieves detailed information about the `ManagedCluster` resource
3. Generates TypeScript code with appropriate configuration
4. Runs `pulumi-cli-preview` to validate the changes
5. Deploys with `pulumi-cli-up`
6. Retrieves the kubeconfig using `pulumi-cli-stack-output`

### Adding monitoring to existing infrastructure

**You:** "Add Application Insights monitoring to my existing Azure web app and configure alerts for high response times."

**AI Assistant response:**

1. Searches for Azure Application Insights resources
2. Generates code to create Application Insights instance
3. Links it to the existing web app
4. Configures alert rules
5. Previews and deploys the changes

### Launching a Neo task

**You:** "Ask Neo to find policy violations for my S3 buckets, and create a GitHub PR with the fix"

**AI Assistant response:**

1. Launches a new Neo task a invites you to navigate to the Pulumi Console using the provided link
2. In the meantime, Neo immediately starts working on a task by creating a plan and completing it step by step
