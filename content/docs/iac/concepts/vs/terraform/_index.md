## Your Infrastructure, Your Programming Language, Your Way

Infrastructure as code shouldn't force you to learn yet another language. While Terraform requires learning HCL and is not open source (using the Business Source License), Pulumi takes an open-source, developer-first approach with Apache 2.0 licensing. With Pulumi, you can:

- **Use Existing Skills**: Write infrastructure code in Python, TypeScript, Java, .NET, or Go
- **Leverage Modern Tools**: Get full IDE support with code completion and error checking
- **Build with Confidence**: Access your language's entire ecosystem of libraries and tools
- **Work Your Way**: Choose between CLI, APIs, or embedding in your applications

## At a Glance

- ðŸ”§ **Terraform**: Proprietary HCL language, Business Source License, community-supported providers
- ðŸ’» **Pulumi**: Open source (Apache 2.0), mainstream languages, native cloud provider integration
- **Key Differences**:
  - Write infrastructure code in your team's preferred language
  - Full IDE support with code completion and type checking
  - Enhanced security with built-in secret encryption
  - Same-day support for new cloud features
  - Built-in testing frameworks
  - Advanced automation capabilities

## True Programming Language Freedom

Pulumi's deep integration with mainstream programming languages isn't just about syntax preferences â€“ it's about unlocking the full power of modern development:

- **Python**: Leverage NumPy for calculations, Pandas for data processing
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Use npm packages, async/await for complex orchestration
- **Java**: Utilize enterprise-grade frameworks and tools
- **Go**: Access powerful concurrency features and standard library
- **.NET**: Integrate with existing enterprise .NET ecosystems
- **YAML**: Available for teams preferring simpler configurations

## Developer-First Features

Pulumi brings modern development practices to infrastructure:
