Install one or more plugins

## Synopsis

Install one or more plugins.

This command is used to manually install plugins required by your program. It
may be run with a specific KIND, NAME, and optionally, VERSION, or by omitting
these arguments and letting Pulumi compute the set of plugins required by the
current project. When Pulumi computes the download set automatically, it may
download more plugins than are strictly necessary.

If VERSION is specified, it cannot be a range; it must be a specific number.
If VERSION is unspecified, Pulumi will attempt to look up the latest version of
the plugin, though the result is not guaranteed.

```
pulumi plugin install [KIND NAME [VERSION]] [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --checksum string   The expected SHA256 checksum for the plugin archive
      --exact             Force installation of an exact version match (usually >= is accepted)
  -f, --file string       Install a plugin from a binary, folder or tarball, instead of downloading it
