Retract a specific revision of an environment

## Synopsis

Retract a specific revision of an environment

This command retracts a specific revision of an environment. A retracted
revision can no longer be read or opened. Retracting a revision also updates
any tags that point to the retracted revision to instead point to a
replacement revision. If no replacement is specified, the latest non-retracted
revision preceding the revision being retracted is used as the replacement.

The revision pointed to by the `latest` tag may not be retracted. To retract
the latest revision of an environment, first update the environment with a new
definition.

```
pulumi env version retract [<org-name>/][<project-name>/]<environment-name>@<version> [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help                  help for retract
      --reason string         the reason for the retraction
      --replace-with string   the version to use to replace the retracted revision
