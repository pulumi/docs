## Synopsis

Show changes between versions

This command displays the changes between two environments or two versions
of a single environment.

The first argument is the base environment for the diff and the second argument
is the comparison environment. If the environment name portion of the second
argument is omitted, the name of the base environment is used. If the version portion of
the second argument is omitted, the 'latest' tag is used.
