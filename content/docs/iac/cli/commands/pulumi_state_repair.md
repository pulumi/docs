Repair an invalid state

## Synopsis

Repair an invalid state,

This command can be used to repair an invalid state file. It will attempt to
sort resources that appear out of order and remove references to resources that
are no longer present in the state. If the state is already valid, this command
will not attempt to make or write any changes. If the state is not already
valid, and remains invalid after repair has been attempted, this command will
not write any changes.
