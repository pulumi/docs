Get the mapping information for a given key from a package

## Synopsis

Get the mapping information for a given key from a package.

<schema_source> can be a package name or the path to a plugin binary. [provider key]
is the name of the source provider (e.g. "terraform", if a mapping was being requested
from Terraform to Pulumi). If you need to pass parameters, you must provide a provider
key. In the event that you wish to pass none, you must therefore explicitly pass an
empty string.

```
pulumi package get-mapping <key> <schema_source> [provider key] [provider parameters] [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help         help for get-mapping
  -o, --out string   The file to write the mapping data to
```
