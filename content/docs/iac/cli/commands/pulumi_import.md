Import resources into an existing stack

## Synopsis

Import resources into an existing stack.

Resources that are not managed by Pulumi can be imported into a Pulumi stack
using this command. A definition for each resource will be printed to stdout
in the language used by the project associated with the stack; these definitions
should be added to the Pulumi program. The resources are protected from deletion
by default.

Should you want to import your resource(s) without protection, you can pass
`--protect=false` as an argument to the command. This will leave all resources unprotected.

A single resource may be specified in the command line arguments or a set of
resources may be specified by a JSON file.

If using the command line args directly, the type token, name, id and optional flags
must be provided.  For example:

    pulumi import 'aws:iam/user:User' name id

The type token and property used for resource lookup are available in the Import section of
the resource's API documentation in the Pulumi Registry (https://www.pulumi.com/registry/).
To fully specify parent and/or provider, subsitute the <urn> for each into the following:

     pulumi import 'aws:iam/user:User' name id --parent 'parent=<urn>' --provider 'admin=<urn>'

When importing multiple resources at once the `--file` option can be used to pass a JSON file
containing multiple resources: 
     pulumi import --file import.json

Where import.json is a file that matches the following JSON format:

    {
        "resources": [
            {
                "type": "aws:ec2/vpc:Vpc",
                "name": "application-vpc",
                "id": "vpc-0ad77710973388316"
            },
            ...
            {
                ...
            }
        ],
    }

The full import file schema references can be found in the [import documentation]
(https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/adopting-pulumi/import/#bulk-import-operations).

The import JSON file can be generated from a Pulumi program by running

    pulumi preview --import-file import.json

This will create entries for all resources that need creating from the preview, filling
in the name, type, parent and provider information and just requiring you to fill in the
resource IDs.


```
pulumi import [type] [name] [id] [flags]
```
