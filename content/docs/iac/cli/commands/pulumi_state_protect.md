protect resource in a stack's state

## Synopsis

Protect resource in a stack's state

This command sets the 'protect' bit on one or more resources, preventing those resources from being deleted.

Caution: this command is a low-level operation that directly modifies your stack's state.
Setting the 'protect' bit on a resource in your stack's state is not sufficient to protect it in
all cases. If your program does not also set the 'protect' resource option, Pulumi will
unprotect the resource the next time your program runs (e.g. as part of a `pulumi up`).

See https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/options/protect/ for more information on
the 'protect' resource option and how it can be used to protect resources in your program.

To unprotect a resource, use `pulumi unprotect`on the resource URN.

To see the list of URNs in a stack, use `pulumi stack --show-urns`.

```
pulumi state protect [resource URN...] [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --all            Protect all resources in the checkpoint
  -h, --help           help for protect
  -s, --stack string   The name of the stack to operate on. Defaults to the current stack
  -y, --yes            Skip confirmation prompts
```
