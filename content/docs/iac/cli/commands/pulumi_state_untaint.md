Untaint one or more resources in the stack's state

## Synopsis

Untaint one or more resources in the stack's state.

After running this, the resources will no longer be destroyed and recreated upon the next `pulumi up`.

To see the list of URNs in a stack, use `pulumi stack --show-urns`.

```
pulumi state untaint [resource URN...] [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --all            Untaint all resources in the checkpoint
  -h, --help           help for untaint
  -s, --stack string   The name of the stack to operate on. Defaults to the current stack
  -y, --yes            Skip confirmation prompts
```
