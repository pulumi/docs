Refresh the resources in a stack

## Synopsis

Refresh the resources in a stack.

This command compares the current stack's resource state with the state known to exist in
the actual cloud provider. Any such changes are adopted into the current stack. Note that if
the program text isn't updated accordingly, subsequent updates may still appear to be out of
sync with respect to the cloud provider's source of truth.

The program to run is loaded from the project in the current directory. Use the `-C` or
`--cwd` flag to use a different directory.

```
pulumi refresh [url] [flags]
```
