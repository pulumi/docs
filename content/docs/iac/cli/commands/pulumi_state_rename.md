Renames a resource from a stack's state

## Synopsis

Renames a resource from a stack's state

This command renames a resource from a stack's state. The resource is specified
by its Pulumi URN and the new name of the resource.

Make sure that URNs are single-quoted to avoid having characters unexpectedly interpreted by the shell.

To see the list of URNs in a stack, use `pulumi stack --show-urns`.


```
pulumi state rename [resource URN] [new name] [flags]
```

## Examples

```
pulumi state rename 'urn:pulumi:stage::demo::eks:index:Cluster$pulumi:providers:kubernetes::eks-provider' new-name-here
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help           help for rename
  -s, --stack string   The name of the stack to operate on. Defaults to the current stack
  -y, --yes            Skip confirmation prompts
