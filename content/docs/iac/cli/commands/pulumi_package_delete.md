Delete a package version from the registry

## Synopsis

Delete a package version from the Pulumi Registry.

The package version must be specified in the format:
  [[<source>/]<publisher>/]<name>[@<version>]

Example:
  pulumi package delete private/myorg/my-package@1.0.0

Warning: If this is the only version of the package, the entire package
will be removed. This action cannot be undone.

You must have publish permissions for the package to delete it.

```
pulumi package delete <source>/<publisher>/<name>@<version> [flags]
```
