Get a value within an environment.

Get a value within an environment

This command fetches the current definition for the named environment and gets a
value within it. The path to the value to set is a Pulumi property path. The value
is printed to stdout as YAML.


```
pulumi env get [<org-name>/][<project-name>/]<environment-name>[@<version>] <path> [flags]
```

## Options

      --definition     Set to print just the definition.
  -h, --help           help for get
      --show-secrets   Show static secrets in plaintext rather than ciphertext
