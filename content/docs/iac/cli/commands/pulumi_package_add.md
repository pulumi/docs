Add a package to your Pulumi project

## Synopsis

Add a package to your Pulumi project.

This command locally generates an SDK in the currently selected Pulumi language
and prints instructions on how to link it into your project. The SDK is based on
a Pulumi package schema extracted from a given resource plugin or provided
directly.

When <provider> is specified as a PLUGIN[@VERSION] reference, Pulumi attempts to
resolve a resource plugin first, installing it on-demand, similarly to:

  pulumi plugin install resource PLUGIN [VERSION]

When <provider> is specified as a local path, Pulumi executes the provider
binary to extract its package schema:

  pulumi package add ./my-provider

For parameterized providers, parameters may be specified as additional
arguments. The exact format of parameters is provider-specific; consult the
provider's documentation for more information. If the parameters include flags
that begin with dashes, you may need to use '--' to separate the provider name
from the parameters, as in:

  pulumi package add <provider> -- --provider-parameter-flag value

When <schema> is a path to a local file with a '.json', '.yml' or '.yaml'
extension, Pulumi package schema is read from it directly:

  pulumi package add ./my/schema.json

```
pulumi package add <provider|schema> [provider-parameter...] [flags]
```
