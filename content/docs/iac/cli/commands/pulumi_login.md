Log in to the Pulumi Cloud

## Synopsis

Log in to the Pulumi Cloud.

The Pulumi Cloud manages your stack's state reliably. Simply run

    $ pulumi login

and this command will prompt you for an access token, including a way to launch your web browser to
easily obtain one. You can script by using `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

By default, this will log in to the managed Pulumi Cloud backend.
If you prefer to log in to a self-hosted Pulumi Cloud backend, specify a URL. For example, run

    $ pulumi login https://api.pulumi.acmecorp.com

to log in to a self-hosted Pulumi Cloud running at the api.pulumi.acmecorp.com domain.

For `https://` URLs, the CLI will speak REST to a Pulumi Cloud that manages state and concurrency control.
You can specify a default org to use when logging into the Pulumi Cloud backend or a self-hosted Pulumi Cloud.

[PREVIEW] If you prefer to operate Pulumi independently of a Pulumi Cloud, and entirely local to your computer,
pass `file://<path>`, where `<path>` will be where state checkpoints will be stored. For instance,

    $ pulumi login file://~

will store your state information on your computer underneath `~/.pulumi`. It is then up to you to
manage this state, including backing it up, using it in a team environment, and so on.

As a shortcut, you may pass --local to use your home directory (this is an alias for `file://~`):

    $ pulumi login --local

[PREVIEW] Additionally, you may leverage supported object storage backends from one of the cloud providers to manage the state independent of the Pulumi Cloud. For instance,

AWS S3:

    $ pulumi login s3://my-pulumi-state-bucket

GCP GCS:

    $ pulumi login gs://my-pulumi-state-bucket

Azure Blob:

    $ pulumi login azblob://my-pulumi-state-bucket


```
pulumi login [<url>] [flags]
```
