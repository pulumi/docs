| application-gateway-waf | Require Application Gateway to have Web Application Firewall enabled | 13.1 | Centralize security event alerting across enterprise assets for log correlation and analysis. Best practice implementation requires the use of a SIEM, which includes vendor-defined event correlation alerts. A log analytics platform configured with security-relevant correlation alerts also satisfies this Safeguard. |
