    Pulumi Cloud provides complete visibility and control over your cloud infrastructure, whether resources were provisioned by Pulumi, Terraform, CloudFormation, or created manually.

    **Two ways to get started:**
    - **New to Pulumi?** Start with [Discovery](/docs/insights/discovery/) to scan existing infrastructure, then add Policy enforcement.
    - **Already using Pulumi IaC?** Add [Policy](/docs/insights/policy/) to enforce compliance before deployments reach production.
