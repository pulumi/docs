Pulumi Policies enables organizations to enforce compliance and best practices using various policy packs. There are two main approaches to policy enforcement: preventative and audit. This guide explains the differences between them and provides guidance on when to use each.

## Policy Groups

A Policy Group is a container for one or more policy packs that you apply to a specific set of Pulumi Entities, such as stacks and accounts. There are two main types of policy groups in Pulumi Policies:

* **Preventative Policy Groups:** These apply to your Pulumi Stacks and are run *before* a stack is deployed to the cloud (during `pulumi up`). They act as guardrails to prevent non-compliant resources from being provisioned. These policies are evaluated at deployment time and can block deployments that violate your organization's policies.
* **Audit Policy Groups:** These apply to [cloud accounts](/docs/insights/accounts/) for continuous policy evaluation through discovery scans. They scan your existing cloud resources to give you a snapshot of your compliance posture across all resources in your cloud accounts, including those not managed by Pulumi.

When Pulumi Policies is first enabled for an organization, Pulumi automatically creates default policy groups. This includes a `default-preventative-policy-group` for stacks and a `default-audit-policy-group` for cloud accounts, making it easy to get started with policy management.

### Comparison at a Glance

| Feature | Preventative Policies | Audit Policies |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| **Target** | Pulumi Stacks | Cloud Accounts |
| **When it Runs** | During `pulumi up` / `pulumi preview` | On a schedule (continuous scan) |
| **Primary Goal** | Prevent non-compliant deployments | Detect existing non-compliant resources |
| **Scope** | Pulumi-managed resources in a stack | All resources within a cloud account |
| **Blocks Deployments?** | **Yes** (with `mandatory` enforcement) | **No** |

## Types of Enforcement

Pulumi provides different enforcement levels for policies. These determine what happens when a policy violation is detected.

* **Advisory:** This enforcement level issues a warning when a policy violation is detected, but does not stop the deployment. This is useful for policies that are informational or when starting to roll out a new policy.
* **Mandatory:** This enforcement level stops the deployment if a policy violation is detected, preventing non-compliant resources from being created or updated. This is ideal for critical security, compliance, or cost-related policies.
* **Remediate:** This enforcement level allows inclusion of remediation resource functions that automatically remediate policy violations. When a violation is detected, Pulumi attempts to fix the non-compliant resource automatically. For more information, see the blog post on [Remediation Policies](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/remediation-policies/).

## When to Use Preventative vs. Audit Policies

Choosing the right policy approach depends on specific use cases and organizational needs:

### Use Preventative Policies When:

* **Enforcing critical compliance rules:** To prevent non-compliant resources from ever being created (e.g., public S3 buckets or unencrypted databases).
* **Managing Pulumi-deployed infrastructure:** To ensure all resources deployed through Pulumi stacks meet organizational standards

### Use Audit Policies When:

* **Authoring new policy packs:** To test and validate policies during development before rolling them out broadly
* **Getting a compliance snapshot:** To understand the current compliance posture of the entire cloud environment including resources not managed by Pulumi
* **Continuous compliance monitoring:** To maintain ongoing visibility into compliance across all cloud accounts
* **Reporting and governance:** To generate compliance reports for auditors or stakeholders and demonstrate continuous monitoring of cloud environments
