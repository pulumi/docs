Pulumi Insights is an intelligent infrastructure management service that helps you discover, understand, manage, and improve your cloud infrastructure. Insights improves security, compliance, and efficiency through AI-powered asset and compliance management.

Pulumi Insights give you the tools to:

- **Discover**: Scan and sync all your cloud infrastructure – including resources provisioned manually or through other tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, and ARM – to bring everything under a single pane of glass. Gain complete visibility across clouds, regions, and accounts.

- **Understand**: Analyze your cloud infrastructure with powerful search and AI-driven insights. Use natural language queries to find resources, identify underutilized or untagged assets, and uncover trends that help you align with business goals.

- **Manage**: Group related resources into logical units that reflect your business priorities. Use these groupings to identify policy violations, enforce tagging standards, and ensure compliance across your organization.

- **Improve**: Optimize your cloud infrastructure with actionable recommendations. Detect and remediate security violations, reduce costs by identifying inefficient resources, and enforce compliance policies.
