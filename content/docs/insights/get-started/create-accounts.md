## Create an Insights account

Navigate to the **Pulumi Insights** section in the Pulumi Cloud console and click **Accounts**. You will be directed to the Accounts landing page where you'll be able to create and manage all your Insights accounts and view scan statuses.

Click **Create Account** and choose your cloud provider (AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud, or Kubernetes)

Click on the drop-down to select your newly created environment `insights-discovery/insights-discovery-env`, then provide a unique account name, such as `Insights-aws-account`.

Add any provider-specific configuration, such as the regions to scan for AWS.

Finally, you can select whether to enable scheduled scans or run them manually, let's keep the default selection.

When scheduled scans are enabled, Pulumi automatically scans the account every 24 hours.

To finish creating this new account lick **Create** and you will see a success notification and arrive on the details page of the account.
