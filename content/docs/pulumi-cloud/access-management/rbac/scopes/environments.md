| `environment:clone` | Create a copy of an existing environment with all its configurations. This is useful for creating staging or testing environments.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Environment Open` |
| `environment:create` | Create a new environment for managing infrastructure configurations. Environments provide isolated spaces for different deployment stages.<br><br>**Granted by default roles**: `Member`, `Admin` |
| `environment:read_decrypt` | Access and decrypt sensitive environment data. This allows viewing encrypted configuration values and secrets.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Environment Open` |
| `environment:delete` | Remove an environment and its associated resources. This permanently deletes the environment and its configurations.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Environment Open` |
| `environment:list` | View all environments in the organization. This provides a list of available environments and their basic information.<br><br>**Granted by default roles**: `Member`, `Admin` |

| `environment:open` | Access and interact with an environment's resources. This includes the ability to view and modify environment configurations.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Environment Open` |
| `environment:read` | View environment configurations and settings. This provides read-only access to environment details and parameters.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Environment Read` |
| `environment:restore_deleted` | Recover a previously deleted environment. This restores the environment and its configurations to their previous state.<br><br>**Granted by default roles**: `Admin` |
| `environment:write` | Modify environment configurations and settings. This allows updating environment parameters and resource definitions.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Environment Write` |
| `environment_yaml:open` | Access and view environment configuration in YAML format. This provides a structured view of environment settings.<br><br>**Granted by default roles**: `Member`, `Admin` |

## Environment Secrets Rotation

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `environment:rotate` | Initiate a rotation of secrets and credentials in an environment. This is a security measure to regularly update sensitive information.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Environment Open` |
