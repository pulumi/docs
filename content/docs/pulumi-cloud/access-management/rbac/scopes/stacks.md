This document defines all the available [scopes](../) in Pulumi Cloud assignable to specific stacks or sets of stacks.

Note that creating, listing, or restoring stacks are organization-level operations, and these scopes can be found in the [organization settings scopes](../org-settings).

## Stacks

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `stack:cancel_update` | Cancel an ongoing stack update operation. This halts the current deployment or update process.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |
| `stack:create` | Create a new stack for managing infrastructure resources. Stacks represent isolated units of deployment.<br><br>**Granted by default roles**: `Admin` |
| `stack:decrypt` | Decrypt sensitive stack data. This allows viewing encrypted configuration values and secrets.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Read` |
| `stack:delete` | Delete a stack and its associated resources. This permanently removes the stack from the organization.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Admin` |
| `stack:encrypt` | Encrypt stack data. This secures sensitive information within the stack.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Read` |
| `stack:export` | Export stack data and configurations. This allows creating backups or migrating stacks.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Read` |
| `stack:import` | Import resources into a stack. This allows bringing external resources under management.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |
| `stack:read` | View stack configurations and settings. This provides read-only access to stack details and parameters.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Read` |
| `stack:rename` | Change the name of a stack. This updates the stack's display name across the platform.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Admin` |
| `stack:transfer` | Transfer ownership of a stack to another organization or user. This is used for organizational restructuring or migration.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Admin` |
| `stack:write` | Modify stack configurations and settings. This allows updating stack parameters and resource definitions.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |

## Annotations

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `stack_annotations:read` | View annotations attached to a stack. This provides context and metadata for stack resources.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Read` |
| `stack_annotations:update` | Modify or add annotations to a stack. This allows updating stack metadata and documentation.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |

## Stack Deployments

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `stack_deployment_cache:read` | View the deployment cache for a stack. This includes access to cached deployment artifacts and data.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |
| `stack_deployment:create` | Create a new deployment for a stack. This initiates the deployment process for infrastructure resources.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |
| `stack_deployment:read` | View details of stack deployments. This includes access to deployment status and history.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Read` |
| `stack_deployment_settings:encrypt` | Encrypt deployment settings for a stack. This secures sensitive configuration data.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |
| `stack_deployment_settings:read` | View deployment settings for a stack. This includes access to configuration parameters and metadata.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Read` |
| `stack_deployment_settings:write` | Modify deployment settings for a stack. This allows updating configuration parameters and metadata.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |

## Stack Deploy Schedules

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `stack_schedule:create` | Create a new schedule for automated stack deployments. This allows setting up recurring deployment tasks.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |
| `stack_schedule:delete` | Delete an existing stack deployment schedule. This permanently removes the scheduled task.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |
| `stack_schedule:pause` | Pause a scheduled stack deployment. This temporarily halts the scheduled deployment process.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |
| `stack_schedule:read` | View stack deployment schedule configurations. This includes access to schedule details and execution history.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Read` |
| `stack_schedule:resume` | Resume a paused stack deployment schedule. This restores automated deployment operations.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |
| `stack_schedule:update` | Modify an existing stack deployment schedule. This allows updating timing, frequency, and other schedule parameters.<br><br>**Granted by default permission**: `Stack Write` |

## Stack Tags

| Value | Description |
