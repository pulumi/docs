Permissions in Pulumi Cloud are predefined bundles of [scopes](../scopes) that are commonly used together. They provide a convenient way to grant related access rights to an [entity](./#entities) (resource) or set of entities (resources).

## Entities

An entity is a Pulumi object that can have permissions granted on it.

In Pulumi Cloud's authorization model, we use the term "entity" instead of "resource" to refer to such objects. This is because "resource" already has a specific meaning within Pulumi (referring to cloud infrastructure resources). We use the term "entity" to avoid confusion when discussing authorization.

### Entity types

An entity type is a category of resources that can be protected by the RBAC system. In Pulumi Cloud, entity types include stacks, environments, insights accounts, and organization settings. Each entity type has its own set of associated permissions and can be managed independently through the RBAC system.

When creating a permission, it must be of a specific entity type, and only include scopes that are also of that entity type.

There are four qualified entity types in Pulumi, these are:

* **Stacks**: For all operations that affect stacks. Includes:
  * Stack updates
  * Stack configurations
  * Deployment settings
  * Stack tags and annotations
  * Stack webhooks
  * Stack schedules
* **Environments**: For all operations that affect environments. Includes:
  * Environment configurations
  * Environment secrets
  * Environment schedules
  * Environment webhooks
  * Environment versions
* **Insights accounts**: For all operations that affect insights accounts. Includes:
  * Insights accounts
  * Policy evaluations
  * Scan configurations
  * Results and reports
* **Organization settings**: For scopes and permissions that operate at the org level, like billing settings or managing third-party integrations. Includes:
  * Organization settings
  * Member management
  * Billing and usage
  * Audit logs
  * Integration configurations

## Custom Permissions

### Creating Custom Permissions

To create a custom permission, you must be an organization admin.

Visit **Settings** > **Roles** and click **Permissions**.

![View all organization permissions](/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/rbac/1-create-permission.png).

To create a new permission, click **Create custom permission** within the associated entity group.

You will need to provide a unique name for the permission. Optionally, but recommended, you can provide a description to contextualize the permission and its purpose.

![Create a permission side panel](/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/rbac/2-create-permission.png).

You can then select the scopes you would like to bundle within this permission.

![Providing a name and description for the permission](/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/rbac/3-create-permission.png).

Once you've selected the preferred scopes, click **Create permission**. The panel will close and you should see your new permission on the permissions page.

![Your new permission is visible on the permissions page](/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/rbac/4-create-permission.png).

You can now assign this custom permission to roles within your organization.
