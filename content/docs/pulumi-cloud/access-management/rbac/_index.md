Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Pulumi Cloud provides a flexible and secure way to manage access to your organization's resources. RBAC allows you to control who can access what resources and what actions they can perform.

## Key Concepts

Pulumi Cloud's RBAC system is built on these core concepts:

- **Teams**: Groups of users that can be assigned roles
- **Roles**: Collections of permissions that define what actions can be performed
- **Permissions**: Predefined bundles of scopes that are commonly used together
- **Scopes**: Granular access rights that define specific actions on resources

## How RBAC Works

1. **Create Teams**: Organize users into teams based on their responsibilities
2. **Define Roles**: Create roles with specific permissions
3. **Assign Roles**: Assign roles to teams or individual users
4. **Manage Access**: Control access to resources through role assignments

## Benefits

- **Granular Access Control**: Define precise access levels for different resources
- **Simplified Management**: Manage access through teams and roles
- **Security**: Enforce least privilege access
- **Scalability**: Easily manage access as your organization grows
