## Overview

Audit logs enable you to track the activity of users within an
organization. They display what a user did, when
they did it and where by recording user actions.

Pulumi's audit logs allow you to account for the activity your
users are taking within your organization. The logs are immutable and
and record all user actions. Auditing makes the activity
of members in an organization attributable.
The logs capture the UNIX timestamp of the event, the user
who invoked the action, the event that took place, and the source IP
of the call the user made.

## View Audit Logs

Audit logs are a Enterprise Edition and Business Critical feature. Only organization admins can view audit logs.

To view audit logs:

1. Navigate to the organization's **Settings**.
1. Navigate to **Audit Logs**.

This will show the most recent events in descending order. You can
also filter logs by a particular user by selecting their profile picture.

```
Timestamp, Name, Login, Event, Description, SourceIP, RequireOrgAdmin, RequireStackAdmin, AuthenticationFailure
```

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                             |

#### CEF Format

CEF (common event format) is an audit and logging event format supported by a wide range of SIEM (security information and event management) systems.

The format is as follows:

```
MMM dd hh:mm:ss host CEF:Version|Device Vendor|Device Product|Device Version|Device Event Class ID|Name|Severity|[Extension]
```

The following fields are part of the standard header defined by CEF:

**Device Vendor**, **Device Product**, **Device Version**: these are strings that uniquely identify the sending device

**Device Event Class ID**: string or integer identifying the type of event reported

**Name**: a human readable description of the event

**Severity**: severity level reflecting the importance of the event

**Extensions**: the extensions field is collection of key-value pairs. These keys come from a pre-defined set as well as some keys that we have
defined on our own. The following is a list of the keys we are setting on the extention field.

Pre-defined keys by the CEF standard:

| Key     | Description                                                                                                          |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dvchost | identifies the device host name.                                             |
| rt      | identifies the time at which the event related to the activity was received. |
| src     | identifies the source that an event refers to in an IP network.              |
| suser   | identifies the source user by user name.                                     |
