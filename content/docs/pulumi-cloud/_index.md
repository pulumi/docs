    [Pulumi Cloud](https://app.pulumi.com) is a secure cloud service for individuals and teams using Pulumi's open-source SDK and Pulumi Environments, Secrets and Configuration (ESC).
    
    It manages deployment state and secrets, enables search across your clouds, runs deployments, integrates with CI/CD, and enforces policies and access controls.

    The Pulumi CLI automatically uses Pulumi Cloud unless you set up a [self-managed backend](/docs/concepts/state/#using-a-self-managed-backend).
