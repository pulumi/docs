{{% notes type="info" %}}
Self-hosting is available in the **Pulumi Business Critical** edition and when using the open source, self-managed backends. If you would like to evaluate the Self-Hosted Pulumi Cloud, sign up for the [30 day trial](/product/self-hosted#self-hosted-trial) or [contact us](/contact/). To use a open source, self-managed backend, such as a cloud storage bucket, see [State and Backends](/docs/concepts/state/).

This guide presents the overall architecture for self-hosting the Pulumi Cloud as well as available reference architectures and related installers.

## Managed Pulumi Cloud vs Self-Hosted Pulumi Cloud

Pulumi Cloud (i.e., [app.pulumi.com](https://app.pulumi.com)) is a fully managed SaaS providing state management, a secrets manager and features such as single sign-on (SSO), audit logs, centralized stack and policy management to name a few. As a SaaS, Pulumi manages all aspects of the service.

The self-hosted version of the service provides all the same capabilities as the SaaS offering. The self-hosted deployment requires that the customer manages data backups and keeping the service running and up to date.  However, the self-hosted solution allows the customer to run the service fully within their own environment.

If you are unsure about whether a self-hosted version of the Pulumi Cloud is right for your organization, [contact us](/contact/) to learn more.

## Deployment Topology

Pulumi can be installed in almost any on-premise or cloud provider environment. The self-hosted install can be integrated with your preferred identity provider as well, such as:

* GitHub Enterprise
* GitLab Enterprise
* SAML SSO
* Email/password identity

Here are some examples of deployment topologies:

For information on ingress and egress from the self-hosted Pulumi Cloud, please see the [network requirements](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/network/) information.

## Deployment Options

The Pulumi Cloud [Docker container images](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/components/) can be run using any OCI-compatible container orchestrator.

However, Pulumi provides [installers](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-self-hosted-installers) to support common deployment environments:

* [Quickstart Docker Compose](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/deployment-options/quickstart-docker-compose/): Using a Pulumi-provided set of docker-compose files and bash scripts, one can deploy a small system for **testing** in a local Docker environment.
* [ECS-Hosted](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/deployment-options/ecs-hosted/): Using a Pulumi-provided set of Pulumi programs written in TypeScript or Go, one can automate the deployment and maintenance of a production-grade self-hosted solution.
* [EKS-Hosted](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/deployment-options/eks-hosted/): Using a Pulumi-provided set of Pulumi programs written in TypeScript, one can automate the deployment and maintenance of a production-grade self-hosted solution running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Sevice (EKS). This solution most closely matches the managed service deployment model.
* [AKS-Hosted](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/deployment-options/aks-hosted/): Using a Pulumi-provided set of Pulumi programs written in TypeScript, one can automate the deployment and maintenance of a production-grade self-hosted solution on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
* [GKE-Hosted](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/deployment-options/gke-hosted/): Using a Pulumi-provided set of Pulumi programs written in TypeScript, one can automate the deployment and maintenance of a production-grade self-hosted solution on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
* [Bring Your Own Infrastructure](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/deployment-options/byo-infra-hosted/): Using a Pulumi-provided set of Pulumi programs written in TypeScript, one can automate the deployment and maintenance of a production-grade self-hosted solution on your own K8s, MySQL and S3-compatible storage,.
* [Local-Docker](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/deployment-options/local-docker/): Using a Pulumi-provided Pulumi program written in TypeScript, one can automate the deployment and maintenance of a production-grade self-hosted solution using a customer-provided docker environment,  a customer-provided MySQL database and a customer-provided object store (e.g. Minio).

## Components

The Pulumi self-hosted [Components](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/components/) consist of Docker images for the Pulumi Cloud's frontend UI and backend API.

## Requirements

The self-hosted Pulumi Cloud has several [requirements](/docs/pulumi-cloud/self-hosted/network/) to enable it to be installed and run on your infrastructure.
