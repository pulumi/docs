Pulumi Visual IaC Import allows platform and development teams to leverage Pulumi Insights to quickly discover existing cloud infrastructure and generate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with minimal effort. Visual Import provides an intuitive 5 step process to bring your infrastructure resources under Pulumi IaC management.

1. Discover and select existing cloud resources across accounts
2. Identify and review resources with a reference/dependent relationship to the previously selected resources
3. Generate and export IaC code in your preferred language
4. Enhance your IaC code using Pulumi Copilot
5. Refine and integrate that code into your own Pulumi projects

This feature is available to users on Team, Enterprise, and Business Critical SKUs with Pulumi Insights enabled.

## **Accessing Visual IaC Import**

1. Log in to [Pulumi Cloud Console](https://app.pulumi.com/)  
2. From the left navigation bar, select **IaC / Import**

This opens the Visual IaC Import workflow.

## **Step 1: Select Resources**

You begin by selecting the cloud resources you want to convert to code.

* The interface displays a resource grid similar to the main Insights Resources page
* Only resources that are not yet managed by Pulumi IaC are listed
* You can search, filter, group, and sort the list to locate relevant resources
* Use the checkboxes on each row to multi-select resources
* You can select individual resources only; group rows are not selectable
* Avoid selecting hundreds of resources at once; the intent is to codify logical components or services

Once youâ€™ve selected the resources, click **Next** to proceed.

## **Step 2: Review Referenced Resources**

In this step, you review resources that are referenced by or dependent on your selected resources. IaC Best Practices suggest creating logical groups or components for related resources. This page makes it easy to find these relationships.

* The page shows grouped resources based on their relationships
* Each group represents a top-level selected resource and its related resources
* You can filter the Reference and Relationship columns to fine-tune what to include

The Referenced Resources view shows the full graph of resources, including indirectly referenced resources.
{{% /notes %}}

You can deselect referenced resources if needed. When you're ready, click **Next**.

## **Step 3: Generate and Review Code**

This step lets you create, review, and refine the generated Pulumi IaC code.

* Choose the target language (e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go, C\#, Java, YAML)
* The editor displays the generated code as a single file and enables you to edit the code to ensure seamless integration into existing code

## **Step 4: Copilot Enhance**

The Copilot Enhance button enables Pulumi Copilot to take an additional pass over the generated code to improve formatting, provide more meaningful variable names and comments and add references between selected components if available.

## **Step 5: Integrate Code**

Once the code is in the format you are happy with, you can:  

* **Copy Code**: Copies the code to your clipboard
* **Download Program**: Saves the code as a file to your local system
  
You can continue to edit the enhanced code and re-run Copilot if changes are made.

All generated resources include the `import` property, which allows Pulumi to recognize and import them into the state during update or preview.

```
pulumi update code.ts
```

When finished, click **Done** to return to the Visual IaC Import start page.

## **Best Practices**

* **Start Small**: Select a small, logical grouping of resources (e.g., a single service or stack)
* **Validate**: Use `pulumi preview` after importing the generated code to confirm correctness
* **Enhance**: Let Copilot help improve readability and conformance with your coding standards
* **Integrate Carefully**: Consider how the generated code fits into your existing IaC structure
