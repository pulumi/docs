This page provides an overview of how to use Pulumi Deployments to automate your infrastructure deployments.

## Getting Started with Deployments

Pulumi Deployments are configured on a per-stack basis. To use Deployments effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Deployment Settings**: First, set up your [deployment settings](./settings) which include source code location, cloud credentials, environment variables, and build requirements.
1. **Set Up Triggers**: Configure how [deployment triggers](./triggers) are initiated. A common pattern is to:
   - Run a `pulumi preview` when a PR is created
   - Run a `pulumi up` when a PR is merged to main
1. **Expand Your Usage**: As you grow more comfortable with Deployments, consider using additional features:
   - [Drift detection](../drift) to automatically detect when your infrastructure differs from its desired state
   - [Review stacks](../review-stacks) for temporary environments on PRs
   - [TTL stacks](../ttl) for ephemeral environments
   - [Post-deployment automation](./post-automation) to create webhooks to trigger additional actions, like updating additional stacks
   - [Webhooks](/docs/pulumi-cloud/webhooks/#deployment-webhooks) for custom automation

## Automating at Scale

For teams managing many stacks or platforms serving multiple teams, you can automate Deployments at scale using:

- The **[Pulumi Cloud Provider](/registry/packages/pulumiservice/api-docs/deploymentsettings)**: Manage deployment settings as code
- The **[REST API](../api)**: Programmatically control all aspects of Deployments

## Additional Resources

- [Private Repositories and Packages](./private-repositories): Configure access to private Git repositories and package feeds
