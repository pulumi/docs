# Pulumi Deployments OIDC Setup

These files describe how to set up OpenID Connect (OIDC) for Pulumi Deployments.

Previously this content was located in `/content/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/oidc/provider/` and contained information for both Pulumi Deployments and ESC. 

The content was moved to this location to:
1. Make it clear that this is the setup for Deployments specifically
2. Remove the ESC content (which is now located in `/content/docs/esc/environments/configuring-oidc/`)
3. Rename the main page from "OpenID provider" to "OIDC Setup" to match the Deployments settings UI

Each page also contains an info note that ESC should be the preferred approach over Deployments OIDC since it's more portable and easier to set up.
