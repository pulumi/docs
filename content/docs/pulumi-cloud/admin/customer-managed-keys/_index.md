## Overview

Pulumi Cloud supports Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) to improve the security and compliance of your data. CMKs allow you
to use your own encryption keys to protect sensitive data in Pulumi Cloud through an external
Key Management System (KMS).

CMKs encrypt data keys, which are used to encrypt data in Pulumi Cloud. When you add your first CMK, all
existing data keys encrypted with the Pulumi-managed key will be automatically re-encrypted with the new CMK. The
encrypted data itself does not change.

Only organization admins can manage CMKs.

{{% notes "info" %}}
Currently, Customer Managed Keys are only used to encrypt data in Pulumi ESC, and only AWS KMS is
supported.
We are working on adding support for more KMS providers and expanding encryption to additional Pulumi products. If you
have specific requirements, please [contact us](/contact/).

## Viewing Customer Managed Keys

To view Customer Managed Keys:

1. Go to the organizationâ€™s **Settings**.
2. Select **Customer Managed Keys**.

The Customer Managed Keys page displays the following details for each key:

- **Name**: The unique name of the key provided by an admin.
- **Type**: The encryption key type, such as AWS KMS.
- **Default**: Indicates if the key is the default encryption key for the organization. All new data keys responsible
  for encrypting data created by your organization will be encrypted with this key.
- **Set as default**: A button to set the key as the default encryption key. This option is unavailable for keys already
  set as default or undergoing re-encryption.
- **Disable**: A button to disable the key. This option is unavailable for default keys or keys undergoing
  re-encryption.

## Adding a Customer Managed Key

Adding a Customer Managed Key enables you to use your own encryption key to protect sensitive data in Pulumi Cloud.

When the first Customer Managed Key is added, all data keys encrypted with the Pulumi-managed key will be automatically
re-encrypted with the new Customer Managed Key. The encrypted data itself does not change.

### AWS KMS

1. Set up a role in AWS IAM and a key in AWS KMS as
   described [here](/docs/pulumi-cloud/admin/customer-managed-keys/aws-kms/).
2. Go to the **Customer Managed Keys** settings page in Pulumi Cloud.
3. Click **Add Customer Managed Key**.
4. Enter a unique name for the key.
5. Provide the **Role ARN** with access to the AWS KMS key.
6. Provide the **Key ARN** of the AWS KMS key. Alias ARNs are also supported.

## Disabling a Customer Managed Key

Disabling a key prevents it from being used to create new data keys, but existing data keys remain encrypted with the
key until they are re-encrypted. You must specify a re-encryption key to re-encrypt existing data keys.

Disabling a key is not available for default keys or keys undergoing re-encryption.

To disable a Customer Managed Key:

1. Click the three-dot menu next to the key you want to disable.
2. Select **Disable**.
3. Choose a re-encryption key to re-encrypt existing data keys.
4. Click **Disable** to confirm.
5. A banner will appear, showing the re-encryption process status. It disappears once the process is complete.

## Disabling All Customer Managed Keys

Disabling all keys prevents them from being used to create new data keys, but existing data keys remain encrypted with
the keys until they are re-encrypted. All data keys will be re-encrypted with the Pulumi-managed key.

To disable all Customer Managed Keys:

1. Click on the wheel button in the top right corner.
2. Click **Disable all Customer Managed Keys**.
3. Confirm the re-encryption process in the dialog that appears.
4. Click **Disable all** to confirm.
5. A banner will appear, showing the re-encryption process status. It disappears once the process is complete.
