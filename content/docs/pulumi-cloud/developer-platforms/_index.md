An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) is a tool platform teams use to provide self-service golden path workflows for users to perform Day 1 and Day 2 activities. Platform engineers codify golden paths by incorporating security, compliance, cost, and other requirements in infrastructure building blocks.

## Pulumi IDP

Pulumi IDP is a bottom-up approach for platform teams to provide self-service workflows to their users, from Day 0 to Day 2. Unlike an Internal Developer Portal, Pulumi IDP facilitates concrete outcomes, not just information consumption.

Pulumi IDP can facilitate workflows across the Day 0-2 spectrum thanks to powerful features like [Private Registry](/docs/idp/get-started/private-registry/), [Components](/docs/iac/concepts/resources/components/), [Templates](docs/pulumi-cloud/developer-portals/templates/), [Services](/docs/idp/get-started/services/), and more. By using a bottom-up approach, platform engineers can codify security, compliance, and operational requirements in their golden paths without additional effort.

Learn more in the [Pulumi IDP get started guide](/docs/idp/get-started/).

## Custom IDP

Pulumi's flexible building blocks can support organizations with bespoke needs who need to build their own IDP.

## Organization Templates

[Organization Templates](/docs/pulumi-cloud/developer-portals/templates) can provide your Pulumi organization with a centralized repository for all your cloud components, best practices, and configurations. They allow your Pulumi organization members to organize, discover, and deploy cloud resources with ease, all within the Pulumi platform or within your own integrations.

We support Organization Templates on the Enterprise and Business Critical editions of Pulumi Cloud.

## New Project Wizard

The [New Project Wizard](/docs/pulumi-cloud/developer-portals/new-project-wizard) allows anyone in your organization to pick a template they want to install and walk through configuring the deployment of that template. There is support for configuring [Pulumi Deployments](/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments/get-started/#new-project-wizard) automatically so that the template can be deployed without needing the Pulumi CLI locally or any other CI/CD configuration.  Just a few clicks, and you have deployed your infrastructure.

## Pulumi Backstage Plugin

[Backstage](https://backstage.io) is an open-source framework for building developer portals. Using the [Pulumi Backstage Plugin](/docs/pulumi-cloud/developer-portals/backstage) you can create new Pulumi projects from your Organization Templates, and you can run previews, updates, or execute [Pulumi Deployments](/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments) directly from your Backstage instance.
