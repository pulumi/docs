Pulumi ESC, as part of the fully managed Pulumi Cloud service, provides secrets and configuration management capabilities without the overhead of infrastructure management. As a managed service, Pulumi handles all aspects of availability, scaling, and maintenance.

The self-hosted version of ESC provides the same secrets and configuration management capabilities as the managed service. While self-hosting requires that your organization manages deployment, data backups, and keeping the service running and up to date, it allows you to run ESC fully within your own environment.

For comprehensive information about self-hosting the Pulumi ESC, please refer to the [Self-hosting the Pulumi Cloud](/docs/pulumi-cloud/admin/self-hosted/) documentation, which provides an overview of the deployment topology, step-by-step deployment instructions and maintenance and upgrade procedures.
