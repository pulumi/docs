Pulumi ESC is available in a self-hosted model, providing the same secrets and configuration management capabilities as the managed Pulumi Cloud. ESC helps teams securely manage infrastructure configurations, enforce best practices, and simplify access controls. All ESC features including hierarchical environments, fine-grained access controls, and integrations with identity providers are fully available in the self-hosted deployment.

## Why self-host Pulumi ESC?

While Pulumi ESC is available as a managed service within Pulumi Cloud, some organizations may prefer to self-host for:

- Compliance and data residency – Ensuring sensitive infrastructure configurations remain within your own environment.
- Custom security policies – Meeting internal security, regulatory, or audit requirements.
- Network control – Deploying within a private network or air-gapped environment.

Self-hosting Pulumi ESC means your organization is responsible for deploying, managing infrastructure, configuring security, performing backups, applying updates, and ensuring availability and scaling.
