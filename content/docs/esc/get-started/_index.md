In a typical application or infrastructure development workflow, there's often a need to maintain multiple environments such as development, staging, and production. Each of these environments might have its own set of configuration values: API endpoints, database connection strings, third-party secrets, and more.

Hardcoding these values or keeping them inside source code is a security risk and makes managing configurations complex. [Pulumi ESC (Environments, Secrets and Configuration)](/docs/esc/) offers a centralized store to manage configuration data, plain-text data, and secrets.

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to use Pulumi ESC as well as the power of this service in managing configuration and secrets.

Before you begin, you can watch the following video which provides a high level overview of how Pulumi ESC works:
