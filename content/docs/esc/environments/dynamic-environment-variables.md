The Pulumi ESC CLI includes a [`run` command](/docs/esc-cli/commands/esc_run/) that allows you to run commands with Pulumi ESC managed environment variables, without exporting them to your shell.

You can run `esc run` using an environment:

```bash
$ esc run <environment-name> <command>
```

For example, to list your S3 buckets with the AWS CLI using environment variables from the `myorg/test` environment:

```bash
$ esc run myorg/test aws s3 ls
2023-10-10 16:09:19 my-s3-bucket
```

If you need to pass one or more flags to the command, prefix the command with `--`:

```bash
$ esc run myorg/test -- aws s3 ls s3://my-s3-bucket --recursive --summarize
...
Total Objects: 5087
   Total Size: 2419123156
```

For additional options and details, see `esc run --help`.
