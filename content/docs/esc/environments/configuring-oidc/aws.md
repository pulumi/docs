This document outlines the steps required to configure Pulumi to use OpenID Connect to authenticate with AWS. OIDC in AWS uses a web identity provider to assume an IAM role. Access to the IAM role is authorized using a trust policy that validates the contents of the OIDC token issued by the Pulumi Cloud.

## Prerequisites

* You must have sufficient AWS IAM privileges to create identity providers and IAM roles.

{{< notes type="warning" >}}
Please note that this guide provides step-by-step instructions based on the official provider documentation which is subject to change. For the most current and precise information, always refer to the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html).
{{< /notes >}}

## Create the identity provider

1. In the navigation pane of the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), choose **Identity providers**, and then choose **Add provider**.
2. In the **Provider type** section, click the radio button next to **OpenID Connect**.
3. For the **Provider URL**, provide the following URL: `https://api.pulumi.com/oidc`
4. For the **Audience** field, the value is the name of your Pulumi organization prefixed with `aws:` (e.g. `aws:{org}`). Then click **Add provider**.
  {{< notes type="info" >}}
  For the `default` project, the audience will use just the Pulumi organization name. This is to prevent regressions for legacy environments.

## Configure the IAM role

Once you have created the identity provider, you will see a notification at the top of your screen prompting you to assign an IAM role.

1. Click the **Assign role** button.
2. Select the **Create a new role** option, then click **Next**.
3. On the IAM **Create role** page, ensure the **Web identity** radio button is selected.
4. In the **Web identity** section:
    * Select `api.pulumi.com/oidc` under **Identity provider**.
    * Select the name of your Pulumi organization under **Audience**. Then click **Next**.
5. On the **Add permissions** page, select the permissions that you want to grant to your Pulumi service. Then click **Next**.
6. Provide a name and optional description for the IAM role. Then click **Create role**.

## Review trust policy

Next, select the **trust relationships** tab, which is where the trust policy of the role is defined.

```bash
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/api.pulumi.com/oidc"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "api.pulumi.com/oidc:aud": "aws:<pulumi-org-name>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This definition currently allows any Pulumi service to assume this role, but only if the request comes from your organization. You can edit this policy to further limit access to this role to just the Pulumi ESC service, and you can make it even more granular by limiting access to a specific environment. For more detailed configuration for how you can set fine grained access control, see the following [customizing claims documenation](/docs/esc/environments/customizing-oidc-claims/).

Before you log out of the AWS console, make sure to make a note of your roleâ€™s ARN value as you will need it in the next step.

## Configure ESC for OIDC

To configure OIDC for Pulumi ESC, create a new environment in the [Pulumi Console](https://app.pulumi.com/). Make sure that you have the correct organization selected in the left-hand navigation menu. Then:

1. Click the **Environments** link.
2. Click the **Create environment** button.
3. Provide a project to create your new environment in and a name for your environment.
4. Click the **Create environment** button.
5. You will be presented with a split-pane editor. Delete the default placeholder content in the editor and replace it with the following code:

    ```yaml
    values:
      aws:
        login:
          fn::open::aws-login:
            oidc:
              duration: 1h
              roleArn: <your-oidc-iam-role-arn>
              sessionName: pulumi-environments-session
      environmentVariables:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${aws.login.accessKeyId}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${aws.login.secretAccessKey}
        AWS_SESSION_TOKEN: ${aws.login.sessionToken}
    ```

6. Replace `<your-oidc-iam-role-arn>` with the value from the previous steps.
7. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Save**.

You can validate that your configuration is working by running either of the following:

* `esc open <your-org>/<your-project>/<your-environment>` command of the [ESC CLI](/docs/esc-cli/)
* `pulumi env open <your-org>/<your-project>/<your-environment>` command of the [Pulumi CLI](/docs/install/)

Make sure to replace `<your-org>`, `<your-project>`, and `<your-environment>` with the values of your Pulumi organization, project, and environment file respectively. You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "aws": {
    "login": {
      "accessKeyId": "ASIA....",
      "secretAccessKey": "rtBS....",
      "sessionToken": "Fwo...."
    }
  },
  "environmentVariables": {
    "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "ASIA....",
    "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "rtBS....",
    "AWS_SESSION_TOKEN": "Fwo...."
  }
}
```

## Subject claim customization

You can [customize](/docs/esc/environments/customizing-oidc-claims/) the subject claim in the OIDC token to control which Pulumi environments or users are allowed to assume a given IAM role. This allows for more granular access control than the default organization-level permissions.

By default, the subject claim has the following format:

`pulumi:environments:org:<organization name>:env:<project name>/<environment name>`

To customize the subject, use the `subjectAttributes` property in your environment configuration. This produces a subject with the prefix:

`pulumi:environments:pulumi.organization.login:{ORGANIZATION_NAME}`

{{< notes type="warning" >}}

For environments within the legacy `default` project, the project will **not** be present in the subject to preserve backwards compatibility. The format of the subject claim when `subjectAttributes` are not set is `pulumi:environments:org:<organization name>:env:<environment name>`. If `currentEnvironment.name` is used as a custom subject attribute it will resolve to only the environment name (e.g. `pulumi:environments:pulumi.organization.login:contoso:currentEnvironment.name:development:pulumi.user.login:personA`). Due to this it is recommended to move your environments out of the `default` project for best security practices.

{{< /notes >}}

## Subject claim example

Consider the following ESC definition for `project/development` environment opened by user `personA`:

```yaml
values:
  aws:
    login:
      fn::open::aws-login:
        oidc:
          ...
          subjectAttributes:
            - currentEnvironment.name
            - pulumi.user.login
```

The OIDC subject claim for this environment would be `pulumi:environments:pulumi.organization.login:contoso:currentEnvironment.name:project/development:pulumi.user.login:personA`. The role may only be assumed by `project/development` environment and user `personA` within the `contoso` organization:

```json
"Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "api.pulumi.com/oidc:aud": "aws:contoso",
    "api.pulumi.com/oidc:sub": "pulumi:environments:pulumi.organization.login:contoso:currentEnvironment.name:project/development:pulumi.user.login:personA"
  }
}
```

The subject always contains the prefix `pulumi:environments:pulumi.organization.login:{ORGANIZATION_NAME}` and every key configured will be appended to this prefix. The list of all possible options for `subjectAttributes` are:

* `rootEnvironment.name`: the name of the environment that is opened first. This root environment in turn opens other imported environments
* `currentEnvironment.name`: the full name (including the project) of the environment where the ESC login provider and `subjectAttributes` are defined
* `pulumi.user.login`: the login identifier of the user opening the environment
* `pulumi.organization.login`: the login identifier of the organization

When importing multiple environments into Pulumi IaC Stack Config, each environment is resolved separately. For example, if you import multiple environments into your Pulumi Stack with `rootEnvironment.name` attribute defined in all of them, then each `rootEnvironment.name` will resolve to the environment name where it is defined.

{{< notes type="info" >}}

If you are integrating Pulumi ESC with Pulumi IaC, the default subject identifier of the environment will be `pulumi:environments:org:contoso:env:<yaml>`.  The literal value of `<yaml>` need to be used and will be the same for all environments. Hence, for best security practices we recommend using `subjectAttributes`. If you want to set environment level or even granular permissions in your trust policy, then we recommend using `subjectAttributes` property.
