Pulumi ESC Rotators are ESC functions that enable you to rotate various credentials both automatically and manually for a number of supported services. Rotated credentials are stored in your ESC Environments, allowing you to easily and securely use them from anywhere. Some of the rotators require you to deploy [Rotation Connectors](/docs/esc/environment/rotation/aws-lambda) in order to rotate credentials inside private networks.

To learn how to set up and use each rotator, follow the links below. All rotators use [login providers](/docs/esc/integrations/dynamic-login-credentials/) for authorization, with the most secure way being OpenID Connect (OIDC) login providers. Learn more about how to configure them in [OpenID Connect](/docs/pulumi-cloud/oidc/) Pulumi Cloud documentation.
