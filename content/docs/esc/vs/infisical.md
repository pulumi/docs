Choosing the right [secrets management](/what-is/what-is-secrets-management/) tool is important, and we want you to have as much information as possible to make the choice that best suits your needs. Weâ€™ve created this document to help you understand how Pulumi ESC compares with Infisical.

## What is Infisical?

Infisical is a secrets management tool that provides a centralized platform for managing and controlling access to secrets. It supports dynamic secret generation, encryption as a service, and comprehensive access policies.

## Pulumi ESC vs. Infisical: Similarities {#similarities}

Like Infisical, Pulumi ESC is a secrets manager for cloud applications and infrastructure. In both ESC and Infisical, secrets can be stored and accessed through a CLI, SDK, or Web editor interface. Granular access controls can be implemented across all secrets.

## Pulumi ESC vs. Infisical: Key Differences {#differences}

There are a couple of fundamental differences between Infisical and Pulumi ESC. First, ESC and Infisical differ in that Infisical can only add and manage secrets stored in Infisical. ESC adopts a truly open ecosystem approach, allowing you to pull secrets stored in most secret and password managers during runtime and use them anywhere. This reduces the time to take full inventory of your secrets across your organization , enabling you to utilize the best solution for the purpose.  Second, Infisical lacks the composability and hierarchical nature of ESC, which increases getting started speed and duplication of secrets. Third, ESC takes a software engineering approach to versioning with ability to add tags and import specific collections of secrets and configuration via those tags, similar to Docker. Fourth, ESC takes a more secure limited privilege path to provisioning dynamic short-term credentials compared to Infisical.

Here's a detailed comparison of the two:
