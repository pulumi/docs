Choosing the right [secrets management](/what-is/what-is-secrets-management/) tool is important, and we want you to have as much information as possible to make the choice that best suits your needs. Weâ€™ve created this document to help you understand how Pulumi ESC compares with Doppler.

## What is Doppler?

Doppler is a secrets management tool that provides a centralized platform for managing and controlling access to secrets. It supports dynamic secret generation, encryption as a service, and comprehensive access policies.

## Pulumi ESC vs. Doppler: Similarities {#similarities}

Like Doppler, Pulumi ESC is a secrets manager for cloud applications and infrastructure. In both ESC and Doppler, secrets can be stored and accessed through a CLI, SDK, or Web editor interface. Secrets can also be pulled from other secrets and password managers. Granular access controls can be implemented across all secrets.

## Pulumi ESC vs. Doppler: Key Differences {#differences}

There are a couple of fundamental differences between Doppler and Pulumi ESC. Doppler has basic per secret inheritance as opposed to fully composable and hierarchical environments of ESC. Second, ESC environments can be managed (create, update, delete) through infrastructure as code. Third, ESC takes a more secure limited privilege path to provisioning dynamic short-term credentials as compared to Doppler.

Here's a detailed comparison of the two:
