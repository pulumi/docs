Pulumi ESC (Environments, Secrets, and Configuration) simplifies how organizations manage secrets and configurations across multiple environments. It enables teams to compose collections of configuration and secrets called *environments*, which can be consumed by various infrastructure and application services. ESC helps ensure security, consistency, and efficiency in handling secrets and configuration.

Pulumi ESC is offered both as a fully managed cloud service in [Pulumi Cloud](/docs/pulumi-cloud/) and self-hosted for scenarios that require isolated environments. ESC has native integration with several products and other Pulumi products, including Pulumi Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The [pulumi/esc project](https://github.com/pulumi/esc) is open source, and contains the evaluation engine for environments, the `esc` CLI.

The diagram above shows four key concepts:

1. ***Environments***: ESC environments are collections of secrets and configuration. Environments are composable from multiple environments and draw from both static and dynamic sources and can be shared to many targets.

2. ***Sources***: ESC can *input* configuration and secrets from a variety of sources, and it has an extensible plugin model for integrating third-party sources. ESC's built-in support for dynamic secret providers, allows for best-practices like generating short-term credentials via OIDC, and dynamically pulling secret values at the time of use, for all major cloud providers.

3. ***Targets***: ESC *outputs* configuration and secrets to a variety of popular targets. Pulumi ESC has a rich API that allows for easy integration, and provides standard output mechanisms like environment variables and key files.

4. ***Management***: ESC environments are centrally managed in Pulumi Cloud, and can be permissioned with RBAC, versioned, tagged, and audited. ESC secrets are encrypted in flight and at rest.

## The ESC Approach

Pulumi ESC takes a distinct approach to managing secrets and configuration that is different from other secret managers. ESC emphasizes flexibility and an open-ecosystem approach to integrations and is specifically designed for managing secrets and configurations across complex multi-cloud environments. Whether used in conjunction with [Pulumi IaC](/docs/iac/) or as a standalone tool, ESC helps streamline operations, reduce duplication, and enhance security for teams across a wide range of use cases.

### Centralized management, composability, and reusability

Pulumi ESC aggregates secrets and configuration from different sources into *environments*. These environments can be composed from other environments, allowing for flexible organization and reuse without duplication.

Pulumi ESC provides fine-grained **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, ensuring that only authorized users and teams can access specific environments and retrieve secrets. Audit logs track who accessed or changed the configurations, enhancing security and accountability.

Pulumi ESC environments can be structured to reflect an organizationâ€™s team structure, security boundaries, or deployment targets. The above diagram shows an example of how a customer might organize and compose different security environments.

Imagine a hypothetical development organization comprised of a few teams:

* The *billing service* team, that manages secrets/config for the payment processor
* The *communications* team, that manages secrets/config for the mailing service and texting service.
* The *central platform* team, that owns most common config, including OIDC config and the keys/config for the feature flag system.

Permissions to these environments can be defined separately to minimize security exposure. They can be reused indepedently or composed into more complex application scenarios.

### Dynamic vs static configurations

Pulumi ESC supports both **static** configurations (e.g. simple key-value pairs) and **dynamic** configurations (values retrieved from third-party providers) in the same environment. This allows teams to mix-and-match the type of configuration they need.

Pulumi ESC also supports **dynamic secret providers**, such as AWS OIDC, Azure KeyVault, GCP Secrets Manager, and more. This allows teams to pull short-lived credentials or other secrets dynamically from external sources.

More detail on dynamic secret providers is available in [Adding OIDC and secrets providers](/docs/esc/environments/working-with-environments/#using-secrets-providers-and-oidc). The [providers list](/docs/esc/integrations/) details the currently supported integrations.

### Configuration-as-Code, automation, and integration everywhere

Like our other products, Pulumi ESC uses an "as-code" approach to configuration and secrets. ESC environments can be composed, managed, and accessed using code written in TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Python, or YAML. The `esc` CLI and our full-featured API allows for scripted use in automated environments like CI/CD. This reduces copy/paste style duplication of credentials and allows for management from a single source of truth. ESC is already deeply integrated into Pulumi IaC and Pulumi Cloud, and provides a number of third-party product integrations both as secrets providers and consumers.
