Log in to the Pulumi Cloud

## Synopsis

Log in to the Pulumi Cloud.

The Pulumi Cloud manages your Pulumi ESC environments. Simply run

    $ esc login

and this command will prompt you for an access token, including a way to launch your web browser to
easily obtain one. You can script by using `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

By default, this will log in to the managed Pulumi Cloud backend.
If you prefer to log in to a self-hosted Pulumi Cloud backend, specify a URL. For example, run

    $ esc login https://api.pulumi.acmecorp.com

to log in to a self-hosted Pulumi Cloud running at the api.pulumi.acmecorp.com domain.

For `https://` URLs, the CLI will speak REST to a Pulumi Cloud that manages state and concurrency control.
You can specify a default org to use when logging into the Pulumi Cloud backend or a self-hosted Pulumi Cloud.

### OIDC token exchange

For secure authentication in CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows, you can use OIDC token exchange to log in without managing long-lived credentials. This feature exchanges a short-lived OIDC token from your identity provider for a Pulumi Cloud access token.

To log in using OIDC token exchange, provide an OIDC token and your organization name:

    $ esc login --oidc-token <token> --oidc-org <org-name>

The `--oidc-token` flag accepts either a raw token string or a file path prefixed with `file://`:

    $ esc login --oidc-token file:///path/to/token.txt --oidc-org my-org

By default, the exchanged token is scoped to your organization. You can optionally scope it to a specific team or user:

    $ esc login --oidc-token <token> --oidc-org my-org --oidc-team my-team

The exchanged access token expires after 2 hours by default. You can customize the expiration using the `--oidc-expiration` flag:

    $ esc login --oidc-token <token> --oidc-org my-org --oidc-expiration 4h

This approach is particularly useful in environments like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or any CI/CD system that provides OIDC tokens, as it eliminates the need to store long-lived Pulumi access tokens as secrets.
