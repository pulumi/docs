Set a value within an environment.

## Synopsis

Set a value within an environment

This command fetches the current definition for the named environment and modifies a
value within it. The path to the value to set is a Pulumi property path. The value
is interpreted as YAML.


```
esc env set [<org-name>/][<project-name>/]<environment-name> <path> <value> [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -f, --file -      If set, the value is read from the specified file. Pass - to read from standard input.
  -h, --help        help for set
      --plaintext   true to leave the value in plaintext
      --secret      true to mark the value as secret
      --string      true to treat the value as a string rather than attempting to parse it as YAML
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --env string   The name of the environment to operate on.
```
