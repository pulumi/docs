The [Pulumi ESC SDK](/docs/esc/development/languages-sdks/) provides a programmatic interface to manage environments, secrets, and configuration directly within your applications. Using the SDK, you can create, update, and delete environments, apply version tags. It also simplifies the secure handling of secrets and configurations, allowing you to retrieve sensitive data like cloud credentials, connection strings, and feature flags at runtime without long-term storage.
