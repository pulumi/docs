## Stack Management

The Pulumi Cloud Console manages stacks, providing safe locking so that your resource state can never
get corrupted by a concurrent update.

Navigate to previous stack updates, and see who applied what change and when. Or see the point-in-time history if an individual cloud resource.

## Collaboration

The Pulumi Cloud Console enables you to Work with other developers and coordinate on updates.

You can use fine-grained [stack permissions]({{< relref "stack-permissions" >}}) to control who has access to stacks,
or use [teams]({{< relref "teams" >}}) for role-based access control.

## Integrations and Extensions

Pulumi is integrated with popular 3rd party services such as [GitHub]({{< ref "/docs/console/continuous-delivery/github-app" >}}).
You can integrate Pulumi into your current [continuous delivery]({{< relref "continuous-delivery" >}}) pipeline.
