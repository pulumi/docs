Pulumi Cloud Console provides ways for you to access your data to power workflows
and integrations.

> Some features are only found in the Pulumi Team and Enterprise editions. See
> [product editions]({{< relref "editions" >}}) for more information.

## Webhooks

Pulumi [webhooks]({{< relref "webhooks" >}}) enable you to trigger custom workflows
in response to events from your Pulumi organization or stack. For example, posting
a notification that production has been updated successfully.

## Project Templates

If you want to share a common cloud application, you can create a reusable
[template]({{< relref "pulumi-button" >}}) to share with other developers.
