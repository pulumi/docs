There are multiple subscription plans available to Pulumi organizations, each offering an expanding set
of features and capabilities.

## Pulumi Community Edition{#community-edition}

When you sign into the Pulumi Cloud Console, an individual organization is created for you and
automatically subscribed to the Pulumi Community edition. The Pulumi Community Edition is
free forever for unlimited individual use.

With your Community Edition organization, you can create an unlimited number of stacks, encrypt
configuration and resource secrets, and browse stack history.

But if you want to collaborate with other developers or use advanced features such as requiring
SAML SSO, you'll need to create a new Pulumi organization.
