The [Pulumi Console](https://app.pulumi.com) supports System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) 2.0 integration with different identity providers. SCIM enables you to manage your users and groups centrally in your Identity Provider (IdP) and then synchronize those users and groups to the Pulumi Console. This support requires Pulumi Enterprise Edition. To learn more about the capabilities of the Enterprise Edition, see the [pricing page]({{< relref "/pricing" >}}).

To set up synchronization between Pulumi and your SAML 2.0 identity provider, refer to one of our example guides:
