1. **What does Crosswalk for Kubernetes include?**

    Crosswalk for Kubernetes is a set of tasks to configure, deploy, and manage
    Kubernetes in production.

    Tasks are segmented by operations, and belong to one of the 6 stacks outlined above.
    The Pulumi code for each stack is available and linked at the top of each task.

    Together, the docs and stack code provide a reference architecture to operate
    and use Kubernetes in production across a team using industry best-practices.

    You can find the Crosswalk reference architecture on [GitHub][pulumi-guides].

    Crosswalk use case.
