           Kubernetes Day 2 operations to administer & update a running cluster & workloads.
aliases: ["/docs/reference/tutorials/kubernetes/tutorial-eks-migrate-nodegroups/"]
---

In this tutorial we'll launch a new, managed Kubernetes cluster in Elastic
Kubernetes Service (EKS) on AWS. Then we'll walk through Kubernetes Day 2 operations
to help you administer and update the cluster, and your workloads running on it.

We'll cover how to:

1. Create various worker node groups with different settings, such as instance types and AMIs.
1. Deploy a workload to the set of node groups: the [NGINX Ingress Controller][ingress-nginx], and a
simple [echoserver][echoserver] app that echo's client request headers.
1. Migrate NGINX from its original node group to a new, updated node
group with zero downtime to it or the echoserver during load testing.
1. And lastly, once migration has completed, we'll decomission the
original node group from Kubernetes and AWS.

{{< aws-eks-prereqs >}}

## Initialize the Pulumi Project

1. Start by cloning the [example][example-gh] to your local machine.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/pulumi/examples
    $ cd examples/aws-ts-eks-migrate-nodegroups
    ```

1. Install the dependencies.

    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

1. Create a new Pulumi [stack][stack] named `dev`.

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init dev
    ```

1. Set the Pulumi [configuration][pulumi-config] variables for the project.

    > **Note:** Select any valid EKS region. The [AMIs][eks-amis] used later must match this region.

    ```bash

    $ pulumi config set aws:region us-west-2
    ```

## Create an EKS cluster and Deploy the Workload

Create the cluster and deploy the workload by running an update:

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

The update takes ~15 minutes and will create the following resources in AWS:

* A VPC in our region, with public & private subnets across all of the region's availability zones.
* The IAM Roles & Instance Profiles for each node group.
* An EKS cluster with `v1.13` of Kubernetes.
* A standard `t2.medium` worker node group using the recent `v1.13.7` worker [AMI][eks-amis], for use by general purpose workloads such as the EchoServer.
* A 2xlarge `t3.2xlarge` worker node group using an older `v1.12.7` worker [AMI][eks-amis], for use use by larger, intensive workloads such as the [NGINX Ingress Controller][ingress-nginx].

Once the update is complete, verify the cluster, node groups, and Pods are up
and running:

```bash
$ pulumi stack output kubeconfig > kubeconfig.json && export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig.json
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide --show-labels -l beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=t2.medium
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide --show-labels -l beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=t3.2xlarge
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide --show-labels
```

### Access the Workload

With the deployment from the previous step completed, we can leverage Pulumi
[stack outputs][stack-outputs] to retrieve the public endpoint of the
AWS Classic Load Balancer exported by the Pulumi program.

This load balancer fronts the NGINX Ingress Controller, which in turn
manages the ingress for the `echoserver`:

```bash
$ pulumi stack output nginxServiceUrl
```

Example:

```
$ pulumi stack output nginxServiceUrl

a3a6ae14f9e6d11e99ea4023e81f316e-1155138699.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com
```

After the load balancer is provisioned and resolvable on AWS, let's access the `echoserver` behind
NGINX:

> **Note:** It can take a few minutes for the load balancer to be resolvable.

```bash
$ export LB=`pulumi stack output nginxServiceUrl`
$ curl -Lv -H "Host: apps.example.com" $LB/echoserver
```

> **Note:** If we used a Kubernetes DNS manager such as
[external-dns][external-dns], we could simply use the FQDN instead of the load
balancer's endpoint with custom host headers.

On success, we'll see output similar to the following:

```
Hostname: echoserver-xlvnkcng-74648fd4dd-8jck4

Pod Information:
	-no pod information available-

Server values:
	server_version=nginx: 1.13.0 - lua: 10008

Request Information:
	client_address=172.16.247.199
	method=GET
	real path=/echoserver
	query=
	request_version=1.1
	request_uri=http://apps.example.com:8080/echoserver

Request Headers:
	accept=*/*
	host=apps.example.com
	user-agent=curl/7.58.0
	x-forwarded-for=172.16.200.230
	x-forwarded-host=apps.example.com
	x-forwarded-port=80
	x-forwarded-proto=http
	x-original-uri=/echoserver
	x-real-ip=172.16.200.230
	x-request-id=b874c43cc675d28c68a0c39069799b10
	x-scheme=http

Request Body:
	-no body in request-
```

With our apps now verified as working and accessible, we're ready to see how we
can leverage Kubernetes and Pulumi to migrate workloads across worker node groups.

## Resource Updates

### Pulumi's `create-before-delete` Approach

Resources under management in Pulumi are [uniquely named][pulumi-urn] using a
Universal Resource Name (URN) to identify and track resources across program
deployments and state changes. Additionally, a [random postfix][pulumi-auto-naming] is added to
resource instantiations to avoid collisions, and to assist in
zero-downtime replacements. This is achieved by using a **create-before-delete**
approach in the Pulumi programming model where:

* The new version of the resource is created.
* Any references to the original resource are updated to point
to the new resource.
* On success of the updates, the original resource is deleted.

These semantics allow Pulumi to replace resources using a blue/green deployment
strategy by default, and this works for most scenarios.

There are situations, as with many Kubernetes workloads, where the intrinsic
details of Pod updates and replacements are encoded in Kubernetes API resources
and scheduling predicates that are managed by the control plane for high-availability.
These management constructs are exempt from the Pulumi engine and require granular handling of
the blue/green deployment of the Pods, and the underlying cloud provider
resources that Kubernetes depends on.

In these specific cases, we can stand up overlapping copies of the
infrastruture stack in the Kubernetes layers and in the cloud provider for
as long as we need to guarantee a smooth transition. This affords us the
ability to administer proper migrations in a blue/green strategy catered to
our use-case, and scenarios like this are completely possible to achieve in Pulumi.

### Kubernetes Workloads: High-Availability (HA) & Rolling Updates

Before we perform an update to our node groups and migrate our workloads, it's
important to consider how equipped our workloads are for rolling updates, if they
employ high availability, and if they can gracefully terminate within the Kubernetes [Pod
lifecycle][pod-lifecycle].

Kubernetes has many knobs and levers through API resources to describe your
app's requirements, runtime settings, and update strategy. But it requires
you take the necessary steps to refactor your apps to execute, and survive
in a Kubernetes cluster.

In our example, both NGINX and the `echoserver` are
[stateless][k8s-run-stateless] apps, which means that there is no active state
to manage nor persist across running sessions. Both apps are also equipped to
gracefully terminate, and process [SIGTERM][sigterm] where necessary.
Kubernetes is great at managing stateless apps because it's straight-forward to
run, delete, and most importantly, cleanly recovers in the case of failure
or lack of quorum, as availability is as simple as spinning up another replica.

If you're managing stateful apps, you should consider leveraging
[StatefulSets][statefulsets], as they provide each Pod in the set with a unique
identity and index to employ a systematic approach and ordering to the app's
lifecycle. With that said, Kuberenetes has no insight into the details of your
workload, nor how it operates - this is purposefully done by design.
The work to fully run and operate stateful apps in Kubernetes ultimately lies
with the app developers, operators, and administrators to bake-in and
fine-tune the necessary resilience into the workload and its dependencies
to safely apply updates, and terminate as expected.

As you'll see shortly, we've taken the liberty of using the various
capabilities that Kubernetes offers for HA and rolling updates to support
migration of the NGINX Ingress Controller example.

We highly encourage you to check out the references below to help your
apps achieve proper Kubernetes and production readiness.

## The Great Migration

Upon initial deployment of our workload stack, the `echoserver` will ultimately land
on the Standard node group we've created, given our lack of specificity
for where the Kubernetes scheduler should place it. The NGINX Ingress Controller
instead, specifically targets the `2xlarge` node group given its heftier specs.
Both scheduling choices were made with the intent of segmenting our workloads
by use-case, and performance requirements we've identified.

In our [inital update][initial-update] we selected that our EKS
control plane run on `v1.13.7` of Kubernetes, that the Standard node group
use `v1.13.7` of the [EKS-optimized][eks-amis] worker AMIs, and that the
`2xlarge` node group use `v1.12.7` workers.

Since we do not want our `2xlarge` workers to drift too far apart from the control
plane's version to cause [unsupported skew][version-skew], and we
ultimately realize that the `2xlarge` node group may not suffice for a
large, anticipated request load, we've decided to update various settings of
the node group for NGINX.

The node group that NGINX will select and target will go from:

Using `v1.12.7`of Kubernetes, in a pool of (3) `t3.2xlarge` worker instances ->

Using `v1.13.7`of Kubernetes, in a pool of (5) `c5.4xlarge` worker instances.

### (Optional) Launch load tests.

As we migrate NGINX from the `2xlarge` -> `4xlarge` node group, we'll kick off
a load testing script against the endpoint and path of the `echoserver` on our
cluster to ensure we acheive zero-downtime.

You can install the [`hey`][hey-load-testing] load testing tool locally to your
machine by doing the following:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/rakyll/hey
```

Using the `LB` environment variable previously defined in the
`pulumi stack output` for NGINX's AWS load balancer, and a helper script in
`./scripts`, we'll load test for many iterations of 50,000 requests, with 100
concurrent requests at a time, e.g. run testing across 75 iterations:

```bash
$ export LB=`pulumi stack output nginxServiceUrl`
$ ./scripts/load-testing.sh $LB 75
```

> **Note:** Given the large number of requests being generated during load
> testing (millions), a seperate machine for testing would be best suited
for overall network performance and throughput on your client.

### Step 1: Create the new `4xlarge` node group.

Next, we'll create a new node group in AWS using Pulumi for the `4xlarge` node
group. This is as simple as defining a new node group at the end of `index.ts`:

```typescript
// Create a 4xlarge node group of c5.4xlarge workers. This new node group will
// be used to migrate NGINX away from the 2xlarge node group.
const ng4xlarge = utils.createNodeGroup(`${projectName}-ng-4xlarge`, {
    ami: "ami-03a55127c613349a7", // k8s v1.13.7 in us-west-2
    instanceType: "c5.4xlarge",
    desiredCapacity: 5,
    cluster: myCluster,
    instanceProfile: instanceProfiles[2],
    taints: {"nginx": { value: "true", effect: "NoSchedule"}},
});
```

Append the above snippet into the Pulumi program, and run an update:

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

Once the update is complete, verify the new `c5.4xlarge` node group is up and running:

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide --show-labels -l beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=c5.4xlarge
```

### Step 2: Migrate NGINX to the `4xlarge` node group.

Now, we'll migrate the NGINX service away from the `2xlarge` node group over to the
`4xlarge` node group, by changing its node selector scheduling terms.

This change updates the NGINX Deployment spec to require the use of
`c5.4xlarge` nodes during scheduling, and forces a rolling update over to the
`4xlarge` node group.

![Migrate NGINX 4x-large](/images/docs/reference/kubernetes/migrate-nginx-4xlarge.png)

Edit `index.ts` by setting `nodeSelectorTermValues` to `c5.4xlarge`, and run an update:

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

> **Note:** Given that the termination process must gracefully shutdown, and process
all in-flight requests, this may take a few minutes to complete.

NGINX is able to successfully migrate across node groups because it is
configured with HA settings, spread-type scheduling predicates,
and can gracefully terminate within the Kubernetes [Pod lifecycle][pod-lifecycle].
Check out its setup to learn more.

Once the update is complete, verify the NGINX pods are now running in the new
`4xlarge` node group by retrieving its Pods, the `c5.4xlarge` nodes, and
noticing that the Pods are in fact running on updated nodes.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide --show-labels -l app=nginx-ing-cntlr
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide --show-labels -l beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=c5.4xlarge
```

> **Note:** It may take a couple of minutes for the Pods to fully migrate over, but
> it will do so with zero downtime as demonstrated in the load testing.
<br />
> **Note:** You should also notice a linear up-tick in **requests per second** in the
load testing results, due to the more capable `c5.4xlarge` worker instances
being used.

### Step 3: Decommission the `2xlarge` node group.

With NGINX validated to be up and running on the `4xlarge` node group, we can
now commence the decomissioning of the original `2xlarge` node group no
longer in use.

Decommissioning the node group means that we’ll:

* Drain the Kubernetes nodes.
* Delete the Kubernetes nodes from the APIServer.
* Scale down the Auto Scaling Group to 0.
* Delete the node group.

Setup `kubectl` by using the `kubeconfig` from the stack output.

```bash
$ pulumi stack output kubeconfig > kubeconfig.json
$ export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig.json
```

Instruct the Kubernetes APIServer to drain the `2xlarge` node group using
`kubectl drain`. We've added a helper script to facilitate this process:

```bash
$ ./scripts/drain-t3.2xlarge-nodes.sh
```

After draining has completed, let's instruct the Kubernetes APIServer to delete
the nodes from the cluster using `kubectl delete node`:

```bash
$ ./scripts/delete-t3.2xlarge-nodes.sh
```

Scale down the node group Auto Scaling Group completely:

![Scale Down ng-2xlarge](/images/docs/reference/kubernetes/scale-down-ng-2xlarge.png)

Edit `index.ts` by setting the `desiredCapacity` to `0` for the `2xlarge` node group, and run an update:

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

Once the Auto Scaling Group has scaled down, we can delete the node group from AWS and the Pulumi program:

![Remove ng-2xlarge](/images/docs/reference/kubernetes/remove-ng-2xlarge.png)

Delete the snippet above from `index.ts`, and run an update:

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

If you've executed all of the previous steps, then you'll have successfully migrated
NGINX from the `2xlarge` node group to the `4xlarge` group with
zero downtime to it or the `echoserver`, and removed the
`2xlarge` node group completely from Kubernetes and AWS.

You can also verify the load testing results to validate that our requests have all
returned with `HTTP 200` status codes through out the entire migration
process. 🍹🎉

## Clean Up

Run the following command to tear down the resources that are part of our stack.

1. Run `pulumi destroy` to tear down all resources.  You'll be prompted to make sure you really want to delete these resources.

```bash
$ pulumi destroy
```

1. To delete the stack, run the following command.

```bash
$ pulumi stack rm
```

> **Note:** This command deletes all deployment history from the Pulumi Console and cannot be undone.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we saw how to use Pulumi to launch a managed Kubernetes
cluster on AWS EKS with active workloads. Then, we performed a migration
of the apps and underlying cloud provider resources over to new, updated
resources with zero downtime.

Leveraging Kubernetes control plane with Pulumi's Infrastrcture-as-Code (IaC)
semantics allows us to administer over many kinds of update scenarios with
ease. This provides the ability to manage clusters with real code that can
be tracked in version control systems, and deployed as a series of
Pulumi updates through CI/CD.

For a follow-up example on how to further use Pulumi to create Kubernetes
clusters, or deploy workloads to a cluster, check out the rest of the
