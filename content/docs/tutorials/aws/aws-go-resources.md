A Pulumi program that demonstrates creating various AWS resources in Golang

## Deploying the App

To deploy your infrastructure, follow the below steps.

### Prerequisites

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. [Install Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
3. [Configure AWS Credentials](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/aws/setup/)

### Steps

After cloning this repo, from this working directory, run these commands:

1. Next, create a new Pulumi stack, which is an isolated deployment target for this example:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi stack init
    ```

2. Set the required configuration variables for this program:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set aws:region us-west-2
    ```

3. Run `pulumi up` to preview and deploy changes:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi up
    Previewing update (dev):
    ...

    Updating (dev):
    ...
    Resources:
        + 28 created
    Duration: 44s
    ```

## Clean up

1. Run `pulumi destroy` to tear down all resources.

2. To delete the stack itself, run `pulumi stack rm`. Note that this command deletes all deployment history from the Pulumi Console.
