Let's go ahead and deploy your stack:

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

This command evaluates your program and determines the resource updates to make. First, a preview is shown that outlines the changes that will be made when you run the update:

```
Previewing update (dev):

     Type                 Name            Plan
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack  quickstart-dev  create
 +   └─ aws:s3:Bucket     my-bucket       create

Resources:
    + 2 to create

Do you want to perform this update?
> yes
  no
  details
```

Once the preview has finished you are given three options to choose from. Choosing `details` will show you a rich diff of the changes to be made. Choosing `yes` will create your new S3 Bucket in AWS.

```
Do you want to perform this update? yes
Updating (dev):

     Type                 Name            Status
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack  quickstart-dev  created
 +   └─ aws:s3:Bucket     my-bucket       created

Outputs:
    bucketName: "my-bucket-68e33ec"

Resources:
    + 2 created

Duration: 14s
```

Remember the output you defined in the previous step? That [stack output]({{< relref "/docs/intro/concepts/stack#outputs" >}}) can be seen in the `Outputs:` section of your update. For example, the name of the bucket created above is `my-bucket-68e33ec`. To confirm your bucket has been created, let's try to list the contents of your bucket.

{{< chooser language "javascript,typescript,python,go,csharp" / >}}

{{% choosable language javascript %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucket_name)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output bucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```bash
$ aws s3 ls $(pulumi stack output BucketName)
```

{{% /choosable %}}

Running that command should result in no output as your bucket is currently empty. Let's change that by modifying your bucket to host a static website.
