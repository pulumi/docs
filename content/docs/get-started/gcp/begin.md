Before you get started using Pulumi, let's run through a few quick steps to ensure your environment is set up correctly.

### Install Pulumi

{{< install-pulumi >}}
{{% notes "info" %}}
All Windows examples in this tutorial assume you are running in PowerShell.
{{% /notes %}}
{{< /install-pulumi >}}

Next, install the required language runtime, if you have not already.

### Install Language Runtime

#### Choose Your Language

{{< chooser language "javascript,typescript,python,go,csharp" / >}}

{{% choosable language "javascript,typescript" %}}
{{< install-node >}}
{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}
{{< install-python >}}
{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}
{{< install-go >}}
{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language "csharp,fsharp,visualbasic" %}}
{{< install-dotnet >}}
{{% /choosable %}}

Finally, configure Pulumi with Google Cloud.

### Configure Pulumi to access your Google Cloud account

Pulumi requires cloud credentials to manage and provision resources. You must use an IAM user or service account that has **Programmatic access** with rights to deploy and manage your Google Cloud resources.

In this guide, you will need an IAM user account with permissions that can create and populate a Cloud Storage bucket, such as those in the predefined Storage Admin (`roles/storage.admin`) or the Storage Legacy Bucket Owner (`roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner`) roles.

For additional information on setting and using Google Cloud credentials, see [Google Cloud Setup]({{< relref "/docs/intro/cloud-providers/gcp/setup" >}}).

Next, you'll create a new project.
