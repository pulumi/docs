Pulumi's Cloud Native SDK makes it easy to target any Kubernetes environment to
provision a cluster, configure and deploy applications, and update them as
required.

Pulumi supports programming against Kubernetes---Minikube, on-premises and
cloud-hosted custom Kubernetes clusters, and the managed services from Google
(GKE), Azure (AKS), and Amazon (EKS). The Pulumi Kubernetes provider
packages and [CLI]({{< relref "/docs/reference/cli" >}})
help you accomplish all these within minutes.

This guide will have you quickly provisioning infrastructure on Kubernetes with
Pulumi in your favorite language.

To get started we will walk through installing Pulumi, installing your preferred language runtime (if needed), and setting up the kubectl CLI. Click the button below to get started.
