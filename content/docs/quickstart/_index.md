Pulumi is a platform for building and deploying cloud infrastructure and applications in your favorite language on any
cloud.

Describe your resources in code -- VMs, networks, databases, containers, serverless functions --
and the CLI safely and reliably manages your cloud resources using an infrastructure-as-code approach.
Create, share, and reuse powerful cloud packages.

Pulumi is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi) and is free to use.
