We've seen how to quickly get started using Azure with Pulumi.

From here, you can dive deeper with additional Azure examples:

* [Azure Function Apps](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-functions): Create a serverless function
* [Azure AppService with SQL and AppInsights](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-appservice): Build an AppService web application that uses SQL and AppInsights
* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-aks-helm): Create an AKS cluster and deploy a Helm Chart into it
* [Azure CosmosDB, AKS and Node.js](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-aks-mean): Stands up an AKS cluster and a MongoDB-flavored instance of CosmosDB used by a Node.js application.
