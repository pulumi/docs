Let's go ahead and deploy your stack:

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

This command evaluates your program and determines the resource updates to make. First, a preview is shown that outlines the changes that will be made when you run the update:

```
Previewing update (dev)

     Type                   Name            Plan
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack    quickstart-dev  create
 +   └─ gcp:storage:Bucket  my-bucket       create

Outputs:
    bucketName: output<string>

Resources:
    + 2 to create

Do you want to perform this update?  [Use arrows to move, enter to select, type to filter]
> yes
  no
  details
```

Once the preview has finished, you are given three options to choose from. Choosing `details` will show you a rich diff of the changes to be made. Choosing `yes` will create your new storage bucket in Google Cloud. Choosing `no` will return you to the user prompt without performing the update operation.

```
Updating (dev)

     Type                   Name            Status
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack    quickstart-dev  created (3s)
 +   └─ gcp:storage:Bucket  my-bucket       created (1s)

Outputs:
    bucketName: "gs://my-bucket-daa12be"

Resources:
    + 2 created

Duration: 4s
```

Remember the output you defined in the previous step? That [stack output](/docs/concepts/stack#outputs) can be seen in the `Outputs:` section of your update. You can access your outputs from the CLI by running the `pulumi stack output [property-name]` command. For example you can print the name of your bucket with the following command:

{{< chooser language "typescript,javascript,python,go,csharp,java,yaml" / >}}

{{% choosable language javascript %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack output bucketName
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack output bucketName
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack output bucket_name
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack output bucketName
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack output bucketName
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language java %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack output bucketName
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```bash
$ pulumi stack output bucketName
```

{{% /choosable %}}

Running that command will print out the name of your bucket.

{{< auto-naming-note resource="bucket" suffix="daa12be" >}}

{{< console-note >}}

Now that your bucket has been provisioned, let's modify the bucket to host a static website.
