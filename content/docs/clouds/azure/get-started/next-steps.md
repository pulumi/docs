Congrats! You've deployed your first project on Microsoft Azure with Pulumi. Here are some next steps, depending on your learning style.

## Try Pulumi ESC (Environments, Secrets, and Configuration)

[Pulumi ESC](/docs/esc/) is a centralized secrets management and orchestration service. It introduces the concepts of _environments_ --- managed collections of static and dynamic settings that you can use to configure any project, stack, application, or service, including with short-lived cloud credentials through OpenID Connect.

With Pulumi ESC you can:

- **Stop secret sprawl.** Pull and sync configuration and secrets with any secrets store – including HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager, 1Password, and more – and consume in any application, tool, or CI/CD platform.
- **Trust (and prove) your secrets are secure.** Every environment can be locked down with role-based access controls (RBAC) and versioned with all changes fully logged for auditing.
- **Ditch `.env` files.** No more storing secrets in plaintext on dev computers. Developers can easily access secrets via CLI, API, Kubernetes operator, the Pulumi Cloud UI, and in-code with Typescript/Javascript, Python, and Go SDKs.
