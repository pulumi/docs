Congrats! You've deployed your first project on AWS with Pulumi. Here are some next steps, depending on your learning style.

## Try a tutorial

Let our AWS tutorials guide you through key Pulumi concepts.

## Launch a new project with a template

Easily deploy the most common cloud architectures, from [static websites](/templates/static-website/aws/) to [serverless applications](/templates/serverless-application/aws/), [virtual machines](/templates/virtual-machine/aws/), [container services](/templates/container-service/aws/), and [Kubernetes clusters](/templates/kubernetes/aws/).

## Dive into the docs

Read more about Pulumi's architecture and foundational concepts in depth, including [projects](/docs/concepts/projects/), [stacks](/docs/concepts/stack/), [configuration](/docs/concepts/config/), [secrets](/docs/concepts/secrets/), [resources](/docs/concepts/resources/), [state](/docs/concepts/state/), and more.

## Try Pulumi ESC (Environments, Secrets, and Configuration)

In this guide, you used [stack configuration](/docs/concepts/config/) and environment variables to configure a single project and stack. Did you know you can also configure multiple Pulumi projects, and even other applications, with [Pulumi ESC](/product/esc/)?

Pulumi ESC introduces the concept of _environments_ --- managed collections of static and dynamic settings that you can use to configure any project, stack, application, or service, including with short-lived cloud credentials through OpenID Connect.
