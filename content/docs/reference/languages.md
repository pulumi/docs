{{< get-started-note >}}

Pulumi is a multi-language runtime. Your choice of language does not affect which
[clouds]({{< relref "clouds/_index.md" >}}) may be targeted. Each language is just as
capable as the other and supports the entire surface area of resources available.

* [Node.js]({{< relref "javascript.md" >}}) - JavaScript, TypeScript, or any other Node.js compatible language
* [Python 3]({{< relref "python.md" >}}) - Python 3.6 or greater
* Go - statically compiled Go binaries (*documentation coming soon*)


If your favorite language isn't listed, it may be on its way soon. Pulumi is [open
source](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi), and it is possible [to add your own
language]({{< relref "faq.md#how-can-i-add-support-for-my-favorite-language" >}}).  For
further questions, [contact us]({{< relref "troubleshooting.md#contact-us" >}}) and let us
know what you're looking for.
