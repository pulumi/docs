`aws..getAvailabilityZone` provides details about a specific availability zone (AZ)
in the current region.

This can be used both to validate an availability zone given in a variable
and to split the AZ name into its component parts of an AWS region and an
AZ identifier letter. The latter may be useful e.g. for implementing a
consistent subnet numbering scheme across several regions by mapping both
the region and the subnet letter to network numbers.

This is different from the `aws..getAvailabilityZones` (plural) data source,
which provides a list of the available zones.
