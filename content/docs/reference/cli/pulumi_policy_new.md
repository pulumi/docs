Create a new Pulumi Policy Pack

### Synopsis

Create a new Pulumi Policy Pack from a template.

To create a Policy Pack from a specific template, pass the template name (such as `aws-typescript`
or `azure-python`).  If no template name is provided, a list of suggested templates will be presented
which can be selected interactively.

Once you're done authoring the Policy Pack, you will need to publish the pack to your organization.
Only organization administrators can publish a Policy Pack.

```
pulumi policy new [template|url] [flags]
```

### Options

      --dir string      The location to place the generated Policy Pack; if not specified, the current directory is used
  -f, --force           Forces content to be generated even if it would change existing files
  -g, --generate-only   Generate the Policy Pack only; do not install dependencies
  -h, --help            help for new
