[PREVIEW] Create a new Pulumi Policy Pack

### Synopsis

Create a new Pulumi Policy Pack from a template.

To create a Policy Pack from a specific template, pass the template name (such as `aws-typescript`
or `azure-python`).  If no template name is provided, a list of suggested templates will be presented
which can be selected interactively.

Once you're done authoring the Policy Pack, you will need to publish the pack to your organization.
Only organization administrators can publish a Policy Pack.

```
pulumi policy new [template|url] [flags]
