---

| Variable | Setting | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PULUMI_HOME` | `<folder-path>` | Overrides the folder where the Pulumi CLI stores its artifacts: plugins, workspaces, templates, and credentials file. By default, artifacts are stored next to Pulumi binaries in `~/.pulumi`. |
| `PULUMI_ENABLE_LEGACY_APPLY` | `true`| As of [`1.0.0-beta1`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100-beta1-2019-08-13), input properties are no longer propagated to missing output properties during a `pulumi preview`. If this causes issues in your Pulumi program, set this to `true` to enable the old behavior. |
| `PULUMI_ENABLE_LEGACY_DIFF` | `1` or `true` | As of [`v0.17.23`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#01723-2019-07-16), the detection of differences between the actual and desired state of a resource is left entirely up to that resource's provider. This change can expose bugs in the resource providers that lead to diffs being present even if the desired configuration matches the actual state of the resource. Set this to `1` or `true` to enable the old diff behavior. |
| `PULUMI_TEST_MODE` | `true` | As of [`v0.17.7`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0177-2019-04-17), you can enable a new "test mode" by setting this to `true` in either the Node.js or Python SDK. This mode allows you to unit test your Pulumi programs without needing to run them using the Pulumi CLI. Read the change log for details on limitations and other environment variables that must be set. |
| `PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE` | `<your-passphrase>` | Set this as an environment variable to protect and unlock your configuration values and secrets. Your passphrase is used to generate a unique key for your stack, and configuration and encrypted state values are then encrypted using `AES-256-GCM`. Read [the change log](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#secrets-and-pluggable-encryption) and [Configuration and Secrets]({{< prelref "/docs/intro/concepts/config" >}}) to learn more about Pulumi's configuration and secrets management system. |
| `PULUMI_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK` | `1` or `true` | As of [`v0.17.9`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0179-2019-04-30), you may skip the Pulumi version update check by setting this environment variable. |
| `PULUMI_ENABLE_LEGACY_PLUGIN_SEARCH` | `1` | As of [`v0.16.18`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#01618-2019-03-01), a fix has been released to prevent the Pulumi CLI from loading the newest plugin for a resource provider instead of the requested version. This has the potential to disrupt users that previously had working configurations. Set this environment variable to opt into the legacy plugin load behavior. |
| `PULUMI_PYTHON_CMD` | `<python-version-binary>` | As of [`v0.16.6`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0166-2018-11-28), the Pulumi CLI uses `python3` instead of `python` when running a Python program. Set this environment variable to run a different Python binary. |
| `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `<your-access-token>` | Set this environment variable to authenticate into the Pulumi Service backend and bypass the access token prompt when running `pulumi login`. |
| `PULUMI_DEBUG_PROMISE_LEAKS` | `true` | As of [`v0.12.2`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0166-2018-11-28), the promise leak experience has been improved and shows a simple error message. Set this environment variable to get more verbose error messages when debugging promise leaks. |
| `PULUMI_PREFER_YARN` | `1` or `true` | Set this environment variable to opt-in to using `yarn` instead of `npm` for installing Node.js dependencies. |
