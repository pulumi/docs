Install one or more plugins

### Synopsis

Install one or more plugins.

This command is used manually install plugins required by your program.  It may
be run either with a specific KIND, NAME, and VERSION, or by omitting these and
letting Pulumi compute the set of plugins that may be required by the current
project.  VERSION cannot be a range: it must be a specific number.

If you let Pulumi compute the set to download, it is conservative and may end up
downloading more plugins than is strictly necessary.

```
pulumi plugin install [KIND NAME VERSION] [flags]
```

### Options

      --reinstall       Reinstall a plugin even if it already exists
