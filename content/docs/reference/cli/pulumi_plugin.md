Manage language and resource provider plugins

### Synopsis

Manage language and resource provider plugins.

Pulumi uses dynamically loaded plugins as an extensibility mechanism for
supporting any number of languages and resource providers.  These plugins are
distributed out of band and must be installed manually.  Attempting to use a
package that provisions resources without the corresponding plugin will fail.

You may write your own plugins, for example to implement custom languages or
resources, although most people will never need to do this.  To understand how to
write and distribute your own plugins, please consult the relevant documentation.

The plugin family of commands provides a way of explicitly managing plugins.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for plugin
