[PREVIEW] Continuously update the resources in a stack

### Synopsis

Continuously update the resources in a stack.

This command watches the working directory for the current project and updates the active stack whenever
the project changes.  In parallel, logs are collected for all resources in the stack and displayed along
with update progress.

The program to watch is loaded from the project in the current directory by default. Use the `-C` or
`--cwd` flag to use a different directory.

```
pulumi watch [flags]
