Create or update the resources in a stack

### Synopsis

Create or update the resources in a stack.

This command creates or updates resources in a stack. The new desired goal state for the target stack
is computed by running the current Pulumi program and observing all resource allocations to produce a
resource graph. This goal state is then compared against the existing state to determine what create,
read, update, and/or delete operations must take place to achieve the desired goal state, in the most
minimally disruptive way. This command records a full transactional snapshot of the stack's new state
afterwards so that the stack may be updated incrementally again later on.

The program to run is loaded from the project in the current directory by default. Use the `-C` or
`--cwd` flag to use a different directory.

```
pulumi up [template|url] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -c, --config stringArray           Config to use during the update
      --config-file string           Use the configuration values in the specified file rather than detecting the file name
      --config-path                  Config keys contain a path to a property in a map or list to set
  -d, --debug                        Print detailed debugging output during resource operations
      --diff                         Display operation as a rich diff showing the overall change
      --expect-no-changes            Return an error if any changes occur during this update
  -h, --help                         help for up
  -m, --message string               Optional message to associate with the update operation
  -p, --parallel int                 Allow P resource operations to run in parallel at once (1 for no parallelism). Defaults to unbounded. (default 2147483647)
  -r, --refresh                      Refresh the state of the stack's resources before this update
      --replace stringArray          Specify resources to replace. Multiple resources can be specified using --replace run1 --replace urn2
      --secrets-provider string      The type of the provider that should be used to encrypt and decrypt secrets (possible choices: default, passphrase, awskms, azurekeyvault, gcpkms, hashivault). Onlyused when creating a new stack from an existing template (default "default")
      --show-config                  Show configuration keys and variables
      --show-reads                   Show resources that are being read in, alongside those being managed directly in the stack
      --show-replacement-steps       Show detailed resource replacement creates and deletes instead of a single step
      --show-sames                   Show resources that don't need be updated because they haven't changed, alongside those that do
      --skip-preview                 Do not perform a preview before performing the update
  -s, --stack string                 The name of the stack to operate on. Defaults to the current stack
      --suppress-outputs             Suppress display of stack outputs (in case they contain sensitive values)
  -t, --target stringArray           Specify a single resource URN to update. Other resources will not be updated. Multiple resources can be specified using --target urn1 --target urn2
      --target-dependents            Allows updating of dependent targets discovered but not specified in --target list
      --target-replace stringArray   Specify a single resource URN to replace. Other resources will not be updated. Shorthand for --target urn --replace urn.
  -y, --yes                          Automatically approve and perform the update after previewing it
