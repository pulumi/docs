Import resources into an existing stack

### Synopsis

Import resources into an existing stack.

Resources that are not managed by Pulumi can be imported into a Pulumi stack
using this command. A definition for each resource will be printed to stdout
in the language used by the project associated with the stack; these definitions
should be added to the Pulumi program. The resources are protected from deletion
by default.

Should you want to import your resource(s) without protection, you can pass
`--protect=false` as an argument to the command. This will leave all resources unprotected.

A single resource may be specified in the command line arguments or a set of
resources may be specified by a JSON file. This file must contain an object
of the following form:

    {
        "nameTable": {
            "provider-or-parent-name-0": "provider-or-parent-urn-0",
            ...
            "provider-or-parent-name-n": "provider-or-parent-urn-n",
        },
        "resources": [
            {
                "type": "type-token",
                "name": "name",
                "id": "resource-id",
                "parent": "optional-parent-name",
                "provider": "optional-provider-name",
                "version": "optional-provider-version",
            },
            ...
            {
                ...
            }
        ]
    }

The name table maps language names to parent and provider URNs. These names are
used in the genrated definitions, and should match the corresponding declarations
in the source program. This table is required if any parents or providers are
specified by the resources to import.

The resources list contains the set of resources to import. Each resource is
specified as a triple of its type, name, and ID. The format of the ID is specific
to the resource type. Each resource may specify the name of a parent or provider;
these names must correspond to entries in the name table. If a resource does not
specify a provider, it will be imported using the default provider for its type. A
resource that does specify a provider may specify the version of the provider
that will be used for its import.


```
pulumi import [type] [name] [id] [flags]
