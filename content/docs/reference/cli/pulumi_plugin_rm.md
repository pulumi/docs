Remove one or more plugins from the download cache

### Synopsis

Remove one or more plugins from the download cache.

Specify KIND, NAME, and/or VERSION to narrow down what will be removed.
If none are specified, the entire cache will be cleared.  If only KIND and
NAME are specified, but not VERSION, all versions of the plugin with the
given KIND and NAME will be removed.  VERSION may be a range.

This removal cannot be undone.  If a deleted plugin is subsequently required
in order to execute a Pulumi program, it must be re-downloaded and installed
using the plugin install command.

```
pulumi plugin rm [KIND [NAME [VERSION]]] [flags]
```

### Options

  -a, --all    Remove all plugins
  -h, --help   help for rm
  -y, --yes    Skip confirmation prompts, and proceed with removal anyway
