List stacks

### Synopsis

List stacks

This command lists stacks. By default only stacks with the same project name as the
current workspace will be returned. By passing --all, all stacks you have access to
will be listed.

Results may be further filtered by passing additional flags. Tag filters may include
the tag name as well as the tag value, separated by an equals sign. For example
'environment=production' or just 'gcp:project'.

```
pulumi stack ls [flags]
```
