Renames a resource from a stack's state

### Synopsis

Renames a resource from a stack's state

This command renames a resource from a stack's state. The resource is specified
by its Pulumi URN (use `pulumi stack --show-urns` to get it) and the new name of the resource.

Make sure that URNs are single-quoted to avoid having characters unexpectedly interpreted by the shell.

Example:
pulumi state rename 'urn:pulumi:stage::demo::eks:index:Cluster$pulumi:providers:kubernetes::eks-provider' new-name-here


```
pulumi state rename <resource URN> <new name> [flags]
```
