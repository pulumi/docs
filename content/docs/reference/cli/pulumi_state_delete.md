Deletes a resource from a stack's state

### Synopsis

Deletes a resource from a stack's state

This command deletes a resource from a stack's state, as long as it is safe to do so. The resource is specified 
by its Pulumi URN (use 'pulumi stack --show-urns' to get it).

Resources can't be deleted if there exist other resources that depend on it or are parented to it. Protected resources 
will not be deleted unless it is specifically requested using the --force flag.

Make sure that URNs are single-quoted to avoid having characters unexpectedly interpreted by the shell.

Example:
pulumi state delete 'urn:pulumi:stage::demo::eks:index:Cluster$pulumi:providers:kubernetes::eks-provider'


```
pulumi state delete <resource URN> [flags]
```
