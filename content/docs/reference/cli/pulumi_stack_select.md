Switch the current workspace to the given stack

### Synopsis

Switch the current workspace to the given stack.

Selecting a stack allows you to use commands like `config`, `preview`, and `update`
without needing to type the stack name each time.

If no <stack> argument is supplied, you will be prompted to select one interactively.

```
pulumi stack select [<stack>] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for select
