Show a preview of updates to a stack's resources

### Synopsis

Show a preview of updates a stack's resources.

This command displays a preview of the updates to an existing stack whose state is
represented by an existing state file. The new desired state is computed by running
a Pulumi program, and extracting all resource allocations from its resulting object graph.
These allocations are then compared against the existing state to determine what
operations must take place to achieve the desired state. No changes to the stack will
actually take place.

The program to run is loaded from the project in the current directory. Use the `-C` or
`--cwd` flag to use a different directory.

```
pulumi preview [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -c, --config stringArray           Config to use during the preview
      --config-file string           Use the configuration values in the specified file rather than detecting the file name
      --config-path                  Config keys contain a path to a property in a map or list to set
  -d, --debug                        Print detailed debugging output during resource operations
      --diff                         Display operation as a rich diff showing the overall change
      --expect-no-changes            Return an error if any changes are proposed by this preview
  -h, --help                         help for preview
  -j, --json                         Serialize the preview diffs, operations, and overall output as JSON
  -m, --message string               Optional message to associate with the preview operation
  -p, --parallel int                 Allow P resource operations to run in parallel at once (1 for no parallelism). Defaults to unbounded. (default 2147483647)
  -r, --refresh                      Refresh the state of the stack's resources before this update
      --replace stringArray          Specify resources to replace. Multiple resources can be specified using --replace run1 --replace urn2
      --show-config                  Show configuration keys and variables
      --show-reads                   Show resources that are being read in, alongside those being managed directly in the stack
      --show-replacement-steps       Show detailed resource replacement creates and deletes instead of a single step
      --show-sames                   Show resources that needn't be updated because they haven't changed, alongside those that do
  -s, --stack string                 The name of the stack to operate on. Defaults to the current stack
      --suppress-outputs             Suppress display of stack outputs (in case they contain sensitive values)
  -t, --target stringArray           Specify a single resource URN to update. Other resources will not be updated. Multiple resources can be specified using --target urn1 --target urn2
      --target-dependents            Allows updating of dependent targets discovered but not specified in --target list
      --target-replace stringArray   Specify a single resource URN to replace. Other resources will not be updated. Shorthand for --target urn --replace urn.
```

  -C, --cwd string                   Run pulumi as if it had been started in another directory
      --disable-integrity-checking   Disable integrity checking of checkpoint files
  -e, --emoji                        Enable emojis in the output (default true)

      --logtostderr                  Log to stderr instead of to files
      --non-interactive              Disable interactive mode for all commands
      --profiling string             Emit CPU and memory profiles and an execution trace to '[filename].[pid].{cpu,mem,trace}', respectively
      --tracing file:                Emit tracing to the specified endpoint. Use the file: scheme to write tracing data to a local file
  -v, --verbose int                  Enable verbose logging (e.g., v=3); anything >3 is very verbose
