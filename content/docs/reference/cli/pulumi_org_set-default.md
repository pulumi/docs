Set the default organization for the current backend

### Synopsis

Set the default organization for the current backend.

This command is used to set the default organization in which to create 
projects and stacks for the current backend.

Currently, only the managed and self-hosted backends support organizations. If you try and set a default organization for a backend that does not 
support create organizations, then an error will be returned by the CLI

```
pulumi org set-default [NAME] [flags]
```
