Log into the Pulumi service

### Synopsis

Log into the Pulumi service.

The service manages your stack's state reliably. Simply run

    $ pulumi login

and this command will prompt you for an access token, including a way to launch your web browser to
easily obtain one. You can script by using `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

By default, this will log into `app.pulumi.com`. If you prefer to log into a separate instance
of the Pulumi service, such as Pulumi Enterprise, specify a URL. For example, run

    $ pulumi login https://pulumi.acmecorp.com

to log in to a Pulumi Enterprise server running at the pulumi.acmecorp.com domain.

For `https://` URLs, the CLI will speak REST to a service that manages state and concurrency control.
[PREVIEW] If you prefer to operate Pulumi independently of a service, and entirely local to your computer,
pass `file://<path>`, where `<path>` will be where state checkpoints will be stored. For instance,

    $ pulumi login file://~

will store your state information on your computer underneath `~/.pulumi`. It is then up to you to
manage this state, including backing it up, using it in a team environment, and so on.

As a shortcut, you may pass --local to use your home directory (this is an alias for `file://~`):

    $ pulumi login --local

[PREVIEW] Additionally, you may leverage supported object storage backends from one of the cloud providers to manage the state independent of the service. For instance,

AWS S3:

    $ pulumi login s3://my-pulumi-state-bucket

GCP GCS:

    $ pulumi login gs://my-pulumi-state-bucket

Azure Blob:

    $ pulumi login azblob://my-pulumi-state-bucket


```
pulumi login [<url>] [flags]
```
