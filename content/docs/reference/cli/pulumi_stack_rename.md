Rename an existing stack

### Synopsis

Rename an existing stack.

Note: Because renaming a stack will change the value of `getStack()` inside a Pulumi program, if this
name is used as part of a resource's name, the next `pulumi up` will want to delete the old resource and
create a new copy. For now, if you don't want these changes to be applied, you should rename your stack
back to its previous name.
You can also rename the stack's project by passing a fully-qualified stack name as well. For example:
'robot-co/new-project-name/production'. However in order to update the stack again, you would also need
to update the name field of Pulumi.yaml, so the project names match.

```
pulumi stack rename <new-stack-name> [flags]
```
