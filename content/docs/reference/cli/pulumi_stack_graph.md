Export a stack's dependency graph to a file

### Synopsis

Export a stack's dependency graph to a file.

This command can be used to view the dependency graph that a Pulumi program
admitted when it was ran. This graph is output in the DOT format. This command operates
on your stack's most recent deployment.

```
pulumi stack graph [filename] [flags]
