Export a stack's dependency graph to a file

### Synopsis

Export a stack's dependency graph to a file.

This command can be used to view the dependency graph that a Pulumi program
admitted when it was ran. This graph is output in the DOT format. This command operates
on your stack's most recent deployment.

```
pulumi stack graph [filename] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --dependency-edge-color string   Sets the color of dependency edges in the graph (default "#246C60")
  -h, --help                           help for graph
      --ignore-dependency-edges        Ignores edges introduced by dependency resource relationships
      --ignore-parent-edges            Ignores edges introduced by parent/child resource relationships
