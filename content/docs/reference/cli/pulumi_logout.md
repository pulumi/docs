Log out of the Pulumi service

### Synopsis

Log out of the Pulumi service.

This command deletes stored credentials on the local machine for a single login.

Because you may be logged into multiple backends simultaneously, you can optionally pass
a specific URL argument, formatted just as you logged in, to log out of a specific one.
If no URL is provided, you will be logged out of the current backend.

```
pulumi logout <url> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -c, --cloud-url string   A cloud URL to log out of (defaults to current cloud)
  -h, --help               help for logout
  -l, --local              Log out of using local mode
```
