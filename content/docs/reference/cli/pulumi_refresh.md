Refresh the resources in a stack

### Synopsis

Refresh the resources in a stack.

This command compares the current stack's resource state with the state known to exist in
the actual cloud provider. Any such changes are adopted into the current stack. Note that if
the program text isn't updated accordingly, subsequent updates may still appear to be out of
synch with respect to the cloud provider's source of truth.

The program to run is loaded from the project in the current directory. Use the `-C` or
`--cwd` flag to use a different directory.

```
pulumi refresh [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --config-file string       Use the configuration values in the specified file rather than detecting the file name
  -d, --debug                    Print detailed debugging output during resource operations
      --diff                     Display operation as a rich diff showing the overall change
      --expect-no-changes        Return an error if any changes occur during this update
  -h, --help                     help for refresh
  -m, --message string           Optional message to associate with the update operation
  -p, --parallel int             Allow P resource operations to run in parallel at once (1 for no parallelism). Defaults to unbounded. (default 2147483647)
      --show-replacement-steps   Show detailed resource replacement creates and deletes instead of a single step
      --show-sames               Show resources that needn't be updated because they haven't changed, alongside those that do
      --skip-preview             Do not perform a preview before performing the refresh
  -s, --stack string             The name of the stack to operate on. Defaults to the current stack
      --suppress-outputs         Suppress display of stack outputs (in case they contain sensitive values)
      --suppress-permalink       Suppress display of the state permalink
  -t, --target stringArray       Specify a single resource URN to refresh. Multiple resource can be specified using: --target urn1 --target urn2
  -y, --yes                      Automatically approve and perform the refresh after previewing it
