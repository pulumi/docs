Build infrastructure on any cloud platform. Pulumi supports AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and over 100 cloud providers and services.

## Cloud Platform Overview

Choose your platform and get building:

- **[Clouds Overview](/docs/iac/clouds/)** - Explore all supported cloud platforms
- **Multi-cloud by design** - Use the same tools across all platforms
- **Consistent experience** - Same languages, workflows, and tools everywhere

## Major Cloud Platforms

Get started building on the major cloud providers:

- **[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](/docs/iac/clouds/aws/)** - Build on the world's most comprehensive cloud platform
- **[Microsoft Azure](/docs/iac/clouds/azure/)** - Enterprise cloud services and integration
- **[Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](/docs/iac/clouds/gcp/)** - Google's suite of cloud computing services
- **[Kubernetes](/docs/iac/clouds/kubernetes/)** - Container orchestration and cloud-native apps

## Getting Started by Platform

Jump right into building with platform-specific guides:

- **[AWS Quickstart](/docs/iac/get-started/aws/)** - Deploy your first AWS resources
- **[Azure Quickstart](/docs/iac/get-started/azure/)** - Get started on Microsoft Azure
- **[GCP Quickstart](/docs/iac/get-started/gcp/)** - Build on Google Cloud Platform  
- **[Kubernetes Quickstart](/docs/iac/get-started/kubernetes/)** - Deploy to Kubernetes clusters

## Integration Patterns

Connect your cloud infrastructure with configuration and secrets:

- **[Infrastructure Integration](/docs/esc/integrations/infrastructure/)** - Connect ESC with cloud resources
- **[Pulumi IaC Integration](/docs/esc/integrations/infrastructure/pulumi-iac/)** - Use ESC with your infrastructure code
- **[Kubernetes Integration](/docs/esc/integrations/kubernetes/)** - Manage Kubernetes secrets and config

## Multi-Cloud Advantages

Build infrastructure that spans multiple clouds:

- **Avoid vendor lock-in** - Use the same tools across all platforms
- **Best of breed** - Choose the best services from each cloud
- **Disaster recovery** - Build resilient multi-cloud architectures
- **Cost optimization** - Optimize costs across different providers

## Next Steps

Ready to build on your preferred platform?

1. **Choose your cloud** - Pick AWS, Azure, GCP, or Kubernetes
2. **Follow the quickstart** - Complete your first deployment
3. **Explore advanced patterns** - Learn platform-specific best practices
4. **Connect configuration** - Set up [Configure & Secure](/docs/build/configure-secure/) workflows
