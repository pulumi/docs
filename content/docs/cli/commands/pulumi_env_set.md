Set a value within an environment.

## Synopsis

Set a value within an environment

This command fetches the current definition for the named environment and modifies a
value within it. The path to the value to set is a Pulumi property path. The value
is interpreted as YAML.


```
pulumi env set [<org-name>/]<environment-name> <path> <value> [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help        help for set
      --plaintext   true to leave the value in plaintext
      --secret      true to mark the value as secret
```
