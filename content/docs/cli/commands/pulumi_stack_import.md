Import a deployment from standard in into an existing stack

### Synopsis

Import a deployment from standard in into an existing stack.

A deployment that was exported from a stack using `pulumi stack export` and
hand-edited to correct inconsistencies due to failed updates, manual changes
to cloud resources, etc. can be reimported to the stack using this command.
The updated deployment will be read from standard in.

```
pulumi stack import [flags]
```

### Options

      --file string    A filename to read stack input from
  -f, --force          Force the import to occur, even if apparent errors are discovered beforehand (not recommended)
  -h, --help           help for import
  -s, --stack string   The name of the stack to operate on. Defaults to the current stack
