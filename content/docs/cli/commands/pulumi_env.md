Manage environments

## Synopsis

Manage environments

An environment is a named collection of possibly-secret, possibly-dynamic data.
Each environment has a definition and may be opened in order to access its contents.
Opening an environment may involve generating new dynamic data.

To begin working with environments, run the `env init` command:

    env init

This will prompt you to create a new environment to hold secrets and configuration.
