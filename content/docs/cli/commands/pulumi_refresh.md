Refresh the resources in a stack

## Synopsis

Refresh the resources in a stack.

This command compares the current stack's resource state with the state known to exist in
the actual cloud provider. Any such changes are adopted into the current stack. Note that if
the program text isn't updated accordingly, subsequent updates may still appear to be out of
sync with respect to the cloud provider's source of truth.

The program to run is loaded from the project in the current directory. Use the `-C` or
`--cwd` flag to use a different directory.

```
pulumi refresh [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --clear-pending-creates                 Clear all pending creates, dropping them from the state
      --config-file string                    Use the configuration values in the specified file rather than detecting the file name
  -d, --debug                                 Print detailed debugging output during resource operations
      --diff                                  Display operation as a rich diff showing the overall change
      --expect-no-changes                     Return an error if any changes occur during this update
  -h, --help                                  help for refresh
      --import-pending-creates stringArray    A list of form [[URN ID]...] describing the provider IDs of pending creates
  -j, --json                                  Serialize the refresh diffs, operations, and overall output as JSON
  -m, --message string                        Optional message to associate with the update operation
  -p, --parallel int                          Allow P resource operations to run in parallel at once (1 for no parallelism). (default 16)
      --preview-only                          Only show a preview of the refresh, but don't perform the refresh itself
      --show-replacement-steps                Show detailed resource replacement creates and deletes instead of a single step
      --show-sames                            Show resources that needn't be updated because they haven't changed, alongside those that do
      --skip-pending-creates                  Skip importing pending creates in interactive mode
  -f, --skip-preview                          Do not calculate a preview before performing the refresh
  -s, --stack string                          The name of the stack to operate on. Defaults to the current stack
      --suppress-outputs                      Suppress display of stack outputs (in case they contain sensitive values)
      --suppress-permalink string[="false"]   Suppress display of the state permalink
      --suppress-progress                     Suppress display of periodic progress dots
  -t, --target stringArray                    Specify a single resource URN to refresh. Multiple resource can be specified using: --target urn1 --target urn2
  -y, --yes                                   Automatically approve and perform the refresh after previewing it
