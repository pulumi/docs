Destroy all existing resources in the stack

## Synopsis

Destroy all existing resources in the stack, but not the stack itself

Deletes all the resources in the selected stack.  The current state is
loaded from the associated state file in the workspace.  After running to completion,
all of this stack's resources and associated state are deleted.

The stack itself is not deleted. Use `pulumi stack rm` or the 
`--remove` flag to delete the stack and its config file.

Warning: this command is generally irreversible and should be used with great care.

```
pulumi destroy [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --config-file string                    Use the configuration values in the specified file rather than detecting the file name
      --continue-on-error                     Continue to perform the destroy operation despite the occurrence of errors
  -d, --debug                                 Print detailed debugging output during resource operations
      --diff                                  Display operation as a rich diff showing the overall change
      --exclude-protected                     Do not destroy protected resources. Destroy all other resources.
  -h, --help                                  help for destroy

  -p, --parallel int                          Allow P resource operations to run in parallel at once (1 for no parallelism). (default 16)
      --preview-only                          Only show a preview of the destroy, but don't perform the destroy itself

      --show-config                           Show configuration keys and variables
      --show-replacement-steps                Show detailed resource replacement creates and deletes instead of a single step
      --show-sames                            Show resources that don't need to be updated because they haven't changed, alongside those that do
  -f, --skip-preview                          Do not calculate a preview before performing the destroy
  -s, --stack string                          The name of the stack to operate on. Defaults to the current stack
      --suppress-outputs                      Suppress display of stack outputs (in case they contain sensitive values)

  -t, --target stringArray                    Specify a single resource URN to destroy. All resources necessary to destroy this target will also be destroyed. Multiple resources can be specified using: --target urn1 --target urn2. Wildcards (*, **) are also supported
      --target-dependents                     Allows destroying of dependent targets discovered but not specified in --target list
