Import resources into an existing stack

## Synopsis

Import resources into an existing stack.

Resources that are not managed by Pulumi can be imported into a Pulumi stack
using this command. A definition for each resource will be printed to stdout
in the language used by the project associated with the stack; these definitions
should be added to the Pulumi program. The resources are protected from deletion
by default.

Should you want to import your resource(s) without protection, you can pass
`--protect=false` as an argument to the command. This will leave all resources unprotected.

A single resource may be specified in the command line arguments or a set of
resources may be specified by a JSON file.

If using the command line args directly, the type token, name, id and optional flags
must be provided.  For example:

    pulumi import 'aws:iam/user:User' name id

The type token and property used for resource lookup are available in the Import section of
the resource's API documentation in the Pulumi Registry (https://www.pulumi.com/registry/).
To fully specify parent and/or provider, subsitute the <urn> for each into the following:

     pulumi import 'aws:iam/user:User' name id --parent 'parent=<urn>' --provider 'admin=<urn>'

If using the JSON file format to define the imported resource(s), use this instead:

     pulumi import -f import.json

Where import.json is a file that matches the following JSON format:

    {
        "nameTable": {
            "provider-or-parent-name-0": "provider-or-parent-urn-0",
            ...
            "provider-or-parent-name-n": "provider-or-parent-urn-n",
        },
        "resources": [
            {
                "type": "type-token",
                "name": "name",
                "id": "resource-id",
                "parent": "optional-parent-name",
                "provider": "optional-provider-name",
                "version": "optional-provider-version",
                "pluginDownloadUrl": "optional-provider-plugin-url",
                "logicalName": "optionalLogicalName",
                "properties": ["optional-property-names"],
                "component": false,
                "remote": false,
            },
            ...
            {
                ...
            }
        ],
    }

The name table maps language names to parent and provider URNs. These names are
used in the generated definitions, and should match the corresponding declarations
in the source program. This table is required if any parents or providers are
specified by the resources to import.

The resources list contains the set of resources to import. Each resource is
specified as a triple of its type, name, and ID. The format of the ID is specific
to the resource type. Each resource may specify the name of a parent or provider;
these names must correspond to entries in the name table. If a resource does not
specify a provider, it will be imported using the default provider for its type. A
resource that does specify a provider may specify the version of the provider
that will be used for its import.

A resource can define a logical name as well as its name for the name table.
If a logical name is given, it will be used to name the resource in the Pulumi state.

A resource can also be declared as a "component" (and optionally as "remote"). These resources
don't have an id set and instead just create an empty placeholder component resource in the Pulumi state.

Each resource may specify which input properties to import with;

If a resource does not specify any properties the default behaviour is to
import using all required properties.

You can use `pulumi preview` with the `--import-file` option to emit an import file
for all resources that need creating from the preview. This will fill in all the name,
type, parent and provider information for you and just require you to fill in resource
IDs and any properties.


```
pulumi import [type] [name] [id] [flags]
