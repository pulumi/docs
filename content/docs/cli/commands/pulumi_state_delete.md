Deletes a resource from a stack's state

### Synopsis

Deletes a resource from a stack's state

This command deletes a resource from a stack's state, as long as it is safe to do so. The resource is specified
by its Pulumi URN. If the URN is omitted, this command will prompt for it.

Resources can't be deleted if there exist other resources that depend on it or are parented to it. Protected resources
will not be deleted unless it is specifically requested using the --force flag.

Make sure that URNs are single-quoted to avoid having characters unexpectedly interpreted by the shell.

To see the list of URNs in a stack, use `pulumi stack --show-urns`.


```
pulumi state delete [resource URN] [flags]
```
