        Secrets sprawl is a huge challenge in organizations, particularly for platform engineering teams responsible for securing infrastructure at scale. When you have secrets stored in many places, how do you ensure that practitioners only have access to what they need, and how do you manage and view that access in a single place?

        In this workshop, you'll learn best practices for centralized secrets management to help prevent sprawl, strengthen security, and improve developer experience. We'll explore how to integrate secrets management into your infrastructure and platform engineering workflows, ensuring teams have secure, streamlined access to the credentials they need—without compromising security.

    learn:
        - How to prevent secrets sprawl and improve security across your cloud environments.
        - How centralized secrets management enables access control and visibility at scale.
        - How to integrate secrets management into infrastructure as code and platform engineering workflows for better automation and compliance.
