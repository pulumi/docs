        You know C# and you're working with Azure or planning to. But managing infrastructure with JSON-based ARM templates can be tedious, hard to scale, and disconnected from how you write application code.

        This hands-on workshop shows you how to build real-world Azure infrastructure using Pulumi and your existing .NET skills. You'll learn how to define, deploy, and manage Azure resources in C# using familiar programming tools and patterns.

        Pulumi brings the full power of C# to Infrastructure as Code. You'll move faster, reduce duplication, and build scalable, reliable infrastructure with less friction.

        If you're currently using ARM templates or just starting to explore Azure, this workshop will introduce a more flexible and developer-friendly way to manage your cloud infrastructure.
    learn:
        - How to get started with Pulumi and C# for Azure infrastructure
        - Key concepts of the Pulumi programming model for Infrastructure as Code
        - How to define, provision, and manage Azure resources using .NET
        - Why C# with Pulumi is a powerful alternative to JSON-based ARM templates
        - Examples of reusable and scalable infrastructure written entirely in C#
