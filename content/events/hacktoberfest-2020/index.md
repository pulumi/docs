## About Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

This year, Pulumi is participating in Hacktoberfest with three areas where the community at large can collaborate to build new open source capabilities:

1. **Native Pulumi Providers** - Want Pulumi to work better with your favorite cloud services? We'll show you how to get started building providers that let Pulumi users take full advantage of these services.
2. **Operator and Automation API** - Learn how to use Pulumi's new Kubernetes Superpowers to build truly automated deployments for your workloads.
3. **Reusable Infrastructure Libraries** - Create new abstractions and infrastructure building blocks using Pulumi.

## How to get started

1. **[Register](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com)** on the Hacktoberfest site for access to get credit for your open source contributions.
2. **[Join the Pulumi Community Slack](https://slack.pulumi.com)** and head over to the #Hacktoberfest channel.
3. **Recruit a team to work on your idea** - we'll pin a form on the #Hacktoberfest channel for you to register your team.
4. **Start hacking** - The Pulumi team will share tutorials on this page to help you get started during the hackathon.
