        Platform Engineering teams are responsible for giving developers clear, repeatable playbooks for orchestrating resilient, scalable applications. When using Temporal Cloud, managing Namespaces, Task Queues, and Worker configurations effectively is crucial to ensuring reliability and performance.
        
        In this workshop, we’ll explore how Pulumi empowers teams to define, provision, and manage Temporal Cloud resources using modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices. You'll learn how to automate resource lifecycles, enforce policies, and integrate Temporal Cloud into platform engineering workflows—ensuring developers have a seamless and self-service experience.

    learn:
        - "IaC for Temporal Cloud: Automate the provisioning and lifecycle management of Temporal Namespaces, Task Queues, and Workers using Pulumi."
        - "Consistency & Compliance: Enforce governance, security, and best practices for Temporal Cloud resources across multiple environments."
        - "Hands-on Automation: Trigger a complex deployment cycle with Pulumi Deployments and create approval steps"
