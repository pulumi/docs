        Modern workloads require frequent container builds and deployments, but traditional build processes can be slow and resource-intensive, creating bottlenecks in your delivery pipeline. Docker Build Cloud offers distributed, cached builds that can dramatically reduce build times, while Pulumi provides the orchestration layer to automate your entire deployment workflow using familiar programming languages.

        In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to integrate Docker Build Cloud with Pulumi to create a streamlined container build and deployment pipeline. We'll demonstrate how to leverage Docker Build Cloud's distributed architecture and layer caching to accelerate builds, while using Pulumi to automate the end-to-end process from foundational infrastructure to container build to production deployment.

    learn:
        - How to configure Docker Build Cloud and integrate it with your existing container build pipeline.
        - Techniques for optimizing container builds with intelligent caching and distributed processing.
        - Best practices for automating container deployments using Pulumi's infrastructure as code.
