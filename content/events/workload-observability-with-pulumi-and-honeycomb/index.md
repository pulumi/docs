        In modern platform engineering, seamless observability is essential for maintaining resilient and scalable applications. This workshop will demonstrate how to leverage Pulumi to deploy and manage Honeycomb’s observability capabilities for production workloads. We’ll explore best practices using Pulumi and Honeycomb to ensure that your workloads ship quickly with the observability you need to ensure they stay running. Participants will gain hands-on experience configuring observability in workloads and guidance in setting the SLOs that matter for your organization.

    learn:
        - How Honeycomb helps you detect the production issues that really matter, and resolve them quickly.
        - Automating “observability as code” with Pulumi + Honeycomb.
        - Best practices for incorporating workload observability into your Platform Engineering practice.
