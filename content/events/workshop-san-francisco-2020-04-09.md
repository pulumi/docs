# Infrastructure as Code Workshop

This workshop teaches you Infrastructure as Code concepts through a series of hands-on labs. Topics covered include IaC fundamentals, in addition to application architectures and how to use IaC to create, update, and manage them.

**Slides are available at: [InfrastructureAsCodeWorkshop.pdf](./slides/InfrastructureAsCodeWorkshop.pdf)**

### Lab 1 — Modern Infrastructure as Code

The first lab takes you on a tour of infrastructure as code concepts:

1. [Creating a New Project](./labs/01-iac/01-creating-a-new-project.md)
2. [Configuring](./labs/01-iac/02-configuring-aws.md)
3. [Provisioning Infrastructure](./labs/01-iac/03-provisioning-infrastructure.md)
4. [Updating your Infrastructure](./labs/01-iac/04-updating-your-infrastructure.md)
5. [Making Your Stack Configurable](./labs/01-iac/05-making-your-stack-configurable.md)
6. [Creating a Second Stack](./labs/01-iac/06-creating-a-second-stack.md)
7. [Destroying Your Infrastructure](./labs/01-iac/07-destroying-your-infrastructure.md)

### Lab 2 — Modern Application Architectures

The second lab takes you on a tour of cloud architectures, including VMs, containers, and serverless:

1. [Provisioning EC2 Virtual Machines](./labs/02-app-arch/01-provisioning-vms.md)
3. [Deploying Containers to Elastic Container Service (ECS) "Fargate"](./labs/02-app-arch/02-containers-on-ecs.md)
4. [Deploying Containers to a Kubernetes Cluster](./labs/02-app-arch/03-containers-on-kubernetes.md)
5. [Using Serverless Application Patterns](./labs/02-app-arch/04-lambda-serverless.md)

## Next Steps
