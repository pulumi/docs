        Teams building Internal Developer Platforms are betting that standardization and self-service will bring improved productivity to their engineering organization. In this session, we'll explore how agents can help teams launch platforms faster by simplifying the process of creating reusable abstractions and templates that standardize self-service deployments.
    learn:
        - Building developer self-service platforms faster with agents
        - Creating reusable infrastructure patterns and templates
        - Considerations for balancing developer autonomy with platform governance
        - Handling a surge in infrastructure demand through intelligent automation
