    description: |
        Let’s explore more about building up a containerized microservices architecture on Azure using infrastructure as code and cloud engineering principles. We’ll use Go to build up our new architecture, and we’ll explore more about stacks, inputs and outputs, secrets, and more.

        If you want to code along, you’ll need a [free Pulumi SaaS account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/), [the Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/), [Go](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/languages-sdks/go/), and an Azure account (free tier is okay).
