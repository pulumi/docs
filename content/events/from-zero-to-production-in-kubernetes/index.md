        According to the **[CNCF Annual Survey, 93% of organizations](https://www.cncf.io/reports/cncf-annual-survey-2024/)** are using, piloting, or evaluating Kubernetes as their core platform for modern cloud infrastructure. Engineering teams adopt Kubernetes for its consistency, scalability, and cloud-agnostic flexibility, making it the standard for building and operating developer platforms.
        In this hands-on Kubernetes workshop, you will learn how to take clusters and workloads from zero to production. Explore multi-cloud management, GitOps automation with Argo CD, and strategies for observability and reliability across environments using modern DevOps practices and agentic workflows.
    learn:
        - Multi-cloud Kubernetes infrastructure management
        - Fleet management with GitOps (Argo CD)
        - Cluster and workload observability challenges
