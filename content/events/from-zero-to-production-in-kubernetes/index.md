        Many engineering teams adopt Kubernetes as the basis for their developer platforms because it provides a consistent, cloud-agnostic, and scalable alternative to vendor-specific container services. In this session, we'll explore how to get Kubernetes clusters and workloads to production quickly, leveraging agentic workflows and tooling.

        - Multi-cloud and hybrid infrastructure management
        - Large-scale operations across hundreds of resources
