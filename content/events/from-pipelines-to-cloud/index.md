        In this practical workshop, you’ll set up an Azure DevOps project that builds and deploys cloud resources automatically, with no manual portal clicks required. Along the way, you’ll explore how Infrastructure as Code tools like Pulumi make it simple to version, preview, and safely update your cloud environments. By the end, you’ll have a fully functional DevOps pipeline that provisions real Azure infrastructure and the confidence to extend it for larger projects.
    learn:
        - How to go from zero to a working Azure DevOps pipeline that deploys real cloud infrastructure
        - How to spin up Azure resources automatically - no portal clicking or ARM templates required
        - How to see every infrastructure change before it happens with Pulumi’s preview system
        - How to commit, push, and watch your cloud update itself from your repo
        - How to reuse and extend your pipeline for bigger Azure projects or multiple environments
