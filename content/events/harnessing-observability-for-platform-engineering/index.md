        Platform engineering teams are at the forefront of driving modern, scalable infrastructure, where observability plays a crucial role. As systems grow increasingly complex, ensuring their health and performance can be challenging, but it doesn’t have to be! With Chronosphere and Pulumi, teams are equipped to define observability as code, staying ahead of issues, reducing resource sprawl, and delivering reliable systems at scale.

    learn:
        - "Code-Driven Observability: Create metrics, alerts, and dashboards as code to automate your observability solution, making it efficient and repeatable."
        - "Scaling Your Observability Resources: Deploy and manage cloud-native applications with Pulumi incorporating observability from Day 1 to achieve operational excellence."
        - "Optimizing Telemetry for Cloud-Native Systems: Leverage Chronosphere’s advanced capabilities to reduce noise, prioritize critical signals, and enhance system visibility."
