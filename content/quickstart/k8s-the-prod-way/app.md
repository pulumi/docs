title: Provisioning a Kubernetes Application
aliases: ["app.html"]
---

This lab assumes you have successfully completed [lab 1]({{< relref "identity.md" >}}), and [lab
2]({{< relref "./infrastructure.md" >}}) the results of which are to have (1) successfully bootstrapped the
identity platform for CI/CD and teams, and (2) successfully created the Kubernetes cluster on which
we will deploy.

In this tutorial, we will use this identity to:

* Use the identity provisioned in lab 1 and the Kubernetes cluster provisioned in lab 2 to provision
  a Kubernetes app, Wordpress.

Inside the [Kubernetes the Prod Way repository][ktpw], the `services` directory contains the
Wordpress application and a collection of utility scripts for interacting with it.

## Modeling Kubernetes Applications with code

In the previous examples, we've used Pulumi's TypeScript SDK to define GCP resources for identity
and shared, managed infrastructure.

This example does the same thing, but defines a Kubernetes application. Typically this application
would be managed through CI/CD, using a GCP service account running with permissions defined in the
identity stack, and the kubeconfig file defined in the infrastructure stack -- we'll hook that up
later.

The Pulumi Kubernetes SDK is much like the GCP SDK, in that it is a direct projection of the
Kubernetes API, as defined by the official OpenAPI specification. Also like GCP, users create and
manage Kubernetes resources using classes. But, because the Pulumi SDK is written in a Turing
Complete language, we can also define higher-level libraries for constructs like Helm Charts.

Looking inside [services/wordpress/index.ts][app], we can see code like the following, which is
using the Helm library to define Kubernetes resources.

```typescript
const wordpress = new k8s.helm.v2.Chart(
    "wpdev",
    {
        repo: "stable",
        version: "2.1.3",
        chart: "wordpress"
    },
    { providers: { kubernetes: config.k8sProvider } }
);
```

## Prerequisites: Logging into cloud provider with CLI

In the first lab, we need to set up credentials using the CLI, so that Pulumi can authenticate
against the cloud provider of your choice. Make sure you're still logged in before continuing.

## Provisioning

Begin by `cd`'ing into the `services/wordpress` directory. From there, install the Pulumi toolchain:

```sh
yarn install
```

Like the second lab, the infrastructure stack comes with a script that will allow you to
authenticate using the CI/CD service account we defined in lab 1. This time, we will use the
Kubernetes application developer service account instead of the infrastructure admin account. As in
lab 2, we will later we will use this in CI/CD -- for now we will use it to provision the Kubernetes
application.

Assuming you have successfully finished lab 1, you'll need to specify the name of the identity stack
you've created. This was the argument you passed to `pulumi stack init`.

```sh
./scripts/login-to-ci-service-account.sh <identity-stack-name>
```

As it did in lab 2, this script obtains the client secret for that service account from the identity
stack, and uses `gcloud` to authenticate with it.

```sh
pulumi stack output k8sAppDevCiClientSecret -s "$1" > k8s-app-dev-ci-client-secret.json
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file k8s-app-dev-ci-client-secret.json
rm k8s-app-dev-ci-client-secret.json
```

Similar to what we did in lab 2, we need to specify the name of the infrastructure stack (_not_ the
identity stack) so that this stack can configure itself to use the same project, zone, _etc_., and
so that it can retrieve the kubeconfig file.

```sh
pulumi stack init
pulumi config set infrastructureStackName <infrastructure-stack-name>
pulumi up
```

On success, this should look something like the following.

As we can see, we've deployed a `Deployment` containing the WordPress application, along with a
`StatefulSet` for mariadb, `Secret`s for the passwords, and some `Pod`s that do end-to-end tests.

Looking inside the application file, we see:

```typescript
```

## Stack Outputs: Frontend IP

Much like labs 1 and 2, this stack produces output values that can be referenced in other stacks. If
we run `pulumi stack output`, we see one export value:

* `frontendIp`, public IP address allocated to Wordpress.

If you paste this IP address into a browser, it should take you to the Wordpress landing page.

## Next Steps

In the next lab, we will see how to use the identities defined in lab 1 to set up CI for all of
these stacks.
