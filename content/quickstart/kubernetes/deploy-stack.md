Let's go ahead and deploy the stack:

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

This command instructs Pulumi to determine the resources needed to create the stack. First, a preview is shown of the changes that will be made:

```
Previewing update (dev):

     Type                           Name            Plan
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack            quickstart-dev  create
 +   └─ kubernetes:apps:Deployment  nginx           create

Resources:
    + 2 to create

Do you want to perform this update?
  yes
> no
  details
```

Choosing `yes` will create resources in Kubernetes.

Updating (dev):

     Type                           Name            Status
 +   pulumi:pulumi:Stack            quickstart-dev  created
 +   └─ kubernetes:apps:Deployment  nginx           created

Outputs:
    name: "nginx-xw231xdt"

Resources:
    + 2 created

Duration: 11s
```

The name of the deployment, that we exported, is shown as a [stack output]({{< relref "/reference/stack.md#outputs" >}}).

Next, we'll make some modifications to the program.
