Let's get started with a new project in a new directory.

{{< langchoose nogo >}}

<div class="language-prologue-javascript"></div>

```bash
$ mkdir quickstart && cd quickstart
$ pulumi new kubernetes-javascript
```

<div class="language-prologue-typescript"></div>

```bash
$ mkdir quickstart && cd quickstart
$ pulumi new kubernetes-typescript
```

<div class="language-prologue-python"></div>

```bash
$ mkdir quickstart && cd quickstart
$ pulumi new kubernetes-python
```

> If this is your first time running `pulumi new` (or most other `pulumi` commands), you will be prompted to login to the [Pulumi service](https://app.pulumi.com). The CLI works in tandem with the Pulumi service to deliver a reliable experience, and is free for individual use, with [additional features available for teams](https://www.pulumi.com/pricing/). Hitting enter at the prompt will open a web browser allowing you to sign in or sign up. Alternatively, you may [login]({{< relref "/reference/cli/pulumi_login.md" >}}) or [logout]({{< relref "/reference/cli/pulumi_logout.md" >}}) explicitly if you prefer. See the [FAQ]({{< relref "/reference/faq.md#can-i-use-pulumi-without-depending-on-pulumi-com" >}}) for more information.

After logging in, the CLI will proceed with walking you through creating a new project.

```
This command will walk you through creating a new Pulumi project.

Enter a value or leave blank to accept the (default), and press <ENTER>.
Press ^C at any time to quit.

project name: (quickstart)
project description: (A minimal Kubernetes Pulumi program)
Created project 'quickstart'

stack name: (dev)
Created stack 'dev'
```

First, you will be asked for a project name and description. You can hit enter to accept the default values or enter a new values.

Next, you will be asked for the name of a stack. You can hit enter to accept the default value of `dev`.

> What are [projects]({{< relref "/reference/project.md" >}}) and [stacks]({{< relref "/reference/stack.md" >}})? Pulumi projects and stacks are a way to organize Pulumi code. You can consider a Pulumi Project to be analogous to a GitHub repo: a single place for code â€” and a Stack to be an instance of that code which has separate configuration. For instance, Project Foo may have multiple stacks for Dev, Test, Prod, or perhaps for different cloud configurations (e.g. geographic region). Please [see this guide]({{< relref "/reference/organizing-stacks-projects.md" >}}) for some best practices on organizing your Pulumi projects and stacks.

{{% lang nodejs %}}
After some dependency installations from `npm`, the project and stack will be ready.
{{% /lang %}}

{{% lang python %}}
After the command completes, the project and stack will be ready.
{{% /lang %}}

Next, we'll review the generated project files.
