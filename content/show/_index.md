    title: See how Learning Machine used Pulumi and Amazon ECS to lower their costs by 67%
    body: >
      Learning Machine provides a secure platform, using the blockchain, to issue records in a format that is tamperproof, recipient owned, and independently verifiable. They are witnessing opportunities in several key industries — Public Sector, Healthcare and Education — and need to maximize their resources in order to quickly capitalize on the explosive growth opportunities in front of them. Pulumi offered them a solution which would both simplify existing cloud configurations and help Learning Machine to easily adopt AWS serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda and Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate. This enabled Learning Machine to expedite customer deployments and scale at lower cost.

            We are building a distributed-database-as-a-service product that runs on Kubernetes clusters across multiple
            public clouds including GCP, AWS and others. Pulumi's declarative model, the support for familiar programming
            languages, and the uniform workflow on any cloud make our SRE team much more efficient.
