## Create an AWS Kinesis resource using `@pulumi/aws`

The `@pulumi/aws` library enables fine-grained control over the AWS Kinesis resource meaning it can be coded, deployed, and managed entirely in code.

```javascript
const aws = require("@pulumi/aws");

const stream = new aws.kinesis.Stream("mystream", {
    shardCount: 1
});
```
