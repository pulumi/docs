## The Challenge of Secrets Management in Modern Cloud Environments

Secrets management has changed significantly over the past decade. Gone are the days when secrets could be hardcoded, manually maintained in static configuration files, or left floating around in plaintext on dev machines. Nowadays, cloud environments demand a higher level of sophistication:

1. **Distributed Systems**: Even in multi-cloud and hybrid setups, secrets must be accessible across varied platforms without exposing vulnerabilities.
2. **Dynamic Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, serverless architectures, and ephemeral environments must have secrets that adapt dynamically.
3. **Security Risks**: Hardcoded or poorly managed secrets can lead to catastrophic breaches, costing companies millions in data recovery and compliance penalties.
4. **Operational Burdens**: Manual secrets management is error-prone, inefficient, unscalable, and needs to align with DevOps and DevSecOps best practices.

Pulumi ESC addresses these issues head-on, redefining how cloud engineers manage secrets efficiently, securely, and at scale.
