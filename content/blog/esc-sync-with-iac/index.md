Managing secrets across multi-cloud infrastructures has long been a challenge for developers and operations teams. This article explores an IaC-based strategy to centrally define secrets and configuration in ESC and automatically sync these values across the external platforms where they will be utilized, effectively reducing secret sprawl and manual overhead.

## The Secret Management Conundrum

Traditional secret management often leads to a phenomenon known as secret sprawl. This occurs when secrets are duplicated across multiple systems, including various repositories, cloud providers, and CI/CD pipelines. The result is a tangled web of inconsistencies that makes tracking and managing secrets a Herculean task.

Updating secrets manually across all these systems is not only tedious but also error-prone. Each time a secret changes, it needs to be updated in every repository, cloud platform, and CI/CD tool where it's used. This process is time-consuming and frustrating, often leading to mistakes that can compromise security.

Moreover, the lack of a centralized system makes it difficult to track where secrets are stored and who has access to them. This complicates security audits and compliance efforts. When a secret is compromised, the process of revoking and rotating it across multiple systems can be slow and disruptive, potentially leading to application downtime.

## ESC Sync with Infrastructure as Code

Using Pulumi building blocks like ESC and IaC, we can create a pattern where secrets and configuration can be centrally defined in ESC, and then automatically synced across the external platforms where they will be utilized.

## Embracing a New Era of Secret Management

Using Infrastructure as Code to synchronize secrets and configuration across platform boundaries represents a significant step forward in secret management. By centralizing and automating the handling of sensitive data, it addresses the key challenges of traditional approaches. Secret sprawl becomes a thing of the past, and the risks associated with manual updates are significantly reduced.

Whether you're working with AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secrets Manager or other platforms, Pulumi ESC provides a streamlined solution that ensures your secrets are always secure and up-to-date. It offers the convenience and security of a single source of truth for all your secrets, allowing you to focus on building and improving your applications rather than wrestling with secret management.

We encourage you to explore [Pulumi's documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/esc/get-started) and dive into the [Pulumi ESC Examples repository](https://github.com/pulumi/esc-examples/tree/main/sync) to see how you can implement this powerful tool in your own projects.
