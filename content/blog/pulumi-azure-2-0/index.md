We are happy to announce the release of a new major version of the Pulumi Azure provider. Pulumi Azure 2.0 is based on the 2.0 release of the upstream provider and brings several improvements and breaking changes.

This article outlines the most significant changes:

- Improvements in Azure Storage resources
- New resources for VMs & VM Scale Sets
- Removed deprecated resources and fields
- Latest versions in Callback Functions
- Configuring custom timeouts
- How to migrate and where to get help if needed

The provider release is not directly related to our [Pulumi 2.0 plans](/blog/pulumi-2020-update/).

## Improvements in Azure Storage

We streamlined the experience of working with Azure Storage resources.

The Storage `Account` resource has finally received native support for static website provisioning: it's as simple as declaring a `staticWebsite` property:

``` ts
const storageAccount = new azure.storage.Account("mywebsite", {
    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
    accountReplicationType: "LRS",
    accountKind: "StorageV2",
    staticWebsite: {
        indexDocument: "index.html",
    },
});
```

In version 1.x, the `Blob` resource could upload a file to a storage container, while the `ZipBlob` would take a local directory, zip it, and upload the archive file to a storage container. In 2.0, we deprecated the `ZipBlob` resource and combined both capabilities in `Blob`.

`Blob` can now accept an instance of the `FileAsset` class. `FileAsset` watches the contents of the file on disk, so if the file changes, Pulumi re-uploads the file on the next update.

The following snippet uploads a list of files from a local disk to the newly created static website:

``` ts
foreach (let file in files)
    new azure.storage.Blob(file, {
        storageAccountName: storageAccount.name,
        storageContainerName: "$web",
        type: "Block",
        source: new pulumi.asset.FileAsset(`./wwwroot/${file}`),
        contentType: "text/html",
    }),
);
```

Note that `resourceGroupName` properties were removed from all storage resources except the account: blobs or queues can't belong to a resource group on their own.

## New Resources for Virtual Machine & Virtual Machine Scale Set

There are four new resources for Virtual Machine & Virtual Machine Scale Set separated by operating system: `LinuxVirtualMachine`, `WindowsVirtualMachine`, `LinuxVirtualMachineScaleSet`, `WindowsVirtualMachineScaleSet`. The old-style generic `VirtualMachine` and `VirtualMachineScaleSet` are still available, so you can take your time before migrating existing stacks.

Here is a snippet that defines an Ubuntu VM:

``` ts
const vm = new azure.compute.LinuxVirtualMachine("server-vm", {
    resourceGroupName,
    networkInterfaceIds: [networkInterface.id],
    size: "Standard_A0",
    sourceImageReference: {
        publisher: "Canonical",
        offer: "UbuntuServer",
        sku: "16.04-LTS",
        version: "latest",
    },
    osDisk: {
        caching: "ReadWrite",
        storageAccountType: "Standard_LRS",
    },
    computerName: "hostname",
    adminUsername: username,
    adminPassword: password,
    disablePasswordAuthentication: false,
);
```

## Removing Deprecated Resources, Invokes, and Fields

Azure Active Directory now has its [own Pulumi provider](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azuread/), so all the AD resources were removed from the `AD` namespace of the Azure Provider 2.0.

A number of other resources, invokes, and fields were removed too, following the changes in the upstream provider.

## Default Versions in Callback Functions

[Serverless as Callbacks](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/serverless-as-simple-callbacks-with-pulumi-and-azure-functions) running on Azure Functions have bumped the default version of the Azure Functions runtime to `~3` and `Node.js` to `~12`. As always, you can override the default to set the versions that you require.

Callback Functions also moved from `ZipBlob` to `Blob` deploy as described above, so expect another replacement operation while upgrading.

## Custom Timeouts

Some types of resources take longer to create than others. For instance, provisioning a new Cosmos DB account may take from 10 minutes to over an hour depending on the number of geo locations and other factors.

If the creation of a target resource times out, you can override the default timeout using resource options:

``` ts
const cosmosdbAccount = new azure.cosmosdb.Account("cosmosdb", {
    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
    offerType: "Standard",
    geoLocations: manyLocations,
    consistencyPolicy: { consistencyLevel: "Session" },
}, {
    customTimeouts: {
        create: "30m",
        update: "60m",
    },
});
```

You shouldn't need this ability often, but it can be a lifesaver when you do.

## Explicit Adoption

Pulumi comes with a way [to adopt existing cloud resources](/blog/adopting-existing-cloud-resources-into-pulumi/) by specifying `import` options.

With the 1.x versions of the Azure provider, some resources could become adopted *accidentally*: if a name would match an existing resource, the upsert operation could succeed, and Pulumi would start managing the existing resource.

The 2.0 version of the provider is rigorous in checking the presence of existing resources with matching names before attempting to create new ones. This measure prevents inadvertent adoption and undesired side effects.

## Getting Started with Migration

To get started with Azure provider 2.0, update the versions in your package manager:

{{% chooser language "typescript,csharp,python,go" %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```typescript
// package.json
"@pulumi/azure": "^2.0.0",
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```csharp
// csproj/fsproj/vbproj
<PackageReference Include="Pulumi.Azure" Version="2.1.0-preview" />
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```python
# requirements.txt
pulumi-azure>=2.0.0
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```go
// Gopkg.toml
[constraint]]
  version = "v2.0.0"
  name = "github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure"
```

{{% /choosable %}}
{{% /chooser %}}

There are quite a few breaking changes, so you may need to adjust your code before you can run the program successfully again.

To help with this process, we upgraded all our Azure [templates](https://github.com/pulumi/templates/) and [examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/) to 2.0.

If you want to stay with the 1.x version, please pin your version to `^1.0.0` or `1.14.0` in the package manager.

If you have issues or questions, reach out to us on [Pulumi Community Slack](https://slack.pulumi.com/), and we'll help you through migration.
