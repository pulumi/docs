Unbelievably, we just celebrated Pulumi's 5th birthday. To commemorate, we are publishing multi-part series on all things infrastructure as code, starting with why we’re so excited about it:

- [All Roads Lead Back to Infrastructure as Code](/blog/five-years-of-infrastructure-as-code-part-one/)
- Standing on the Shoulders of Giants
- Infrastructure as Code Internals
- Bringing Applications and Infrastructure Closer Together
- Ringing in the Cloud Engineering Era
- (Bonus) The Future of Infrastructure as Code

We published the first post today, and the others will soon follow in the weeks to come. The above hyperlinks will light up as they go live. We have had so much fun creating Pulumi and sharing it with you, and are just as excited about what’s in store during the next five years too!
