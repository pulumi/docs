We're thrilled to unveil the redesigned [Pulumi Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](/product/infrastructure-as-code/) Stacks page within Pulumi Cloud console, addressing one of the [most upvoted](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-cloud-requests/issues/56) issues in our [Pulumi Cloud Requests repository](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-cloud-requests)! This revamped experience delivers a significant boost in performance and usability, empowering even the most complex organizations to manage their infrastructure with ease.

## Why a New Stacks Page?

As our customers scaled, the previous Stacks page faced some limitations that impacted its effectiveness. Here were some of the primary challenges:

- **Performance Issues**: The page became sluggish with large numbers of stacks, making it difficult to scroll smoothly when you had thousands of stacks.
- **Limited Grouping and Sorting Options**: Users had limited customization options for organizing their stacks, with minimal control over grouping and sorting.
- **Tag-Based Grouping Limitations**: Grouping by tags wasn’t as reliable as we wanted—it sometimes failed to load completely.

## What’s New?

The new Stacks page provides more information at a glance, offering a streamlined and powerful experience:

- **Effortless Scalability**: Manage thousands of stacks with ease. The new page is optimized for performance, ensuring smooth scrolling and interaction regardless of scale.
- **Flexible Grouping**: Group your stacks by repository, project, and tags simultaneously—up to three levels of grouping. Or opt for no grouping at all! The choice is yours. Expand and collapse groups as needed for a more organized and focused browsing experience.
- **Enhanced Sorting**: Sort your stacks by last update or group name (ascending/descending) to quickly find what you need.
- **Shareable Views**: The page now includes query parameters in the URL, allowing you to save and share your exact view with team members effortlessly.
- **Personalized Experience**: The page remembers your last selected groups and sorting preferences, so you can pick up right where you left off.
- **Dynamic Loading**: Enjoy instantaneous loading as you scroll, eliminating wait times and boosting efficiency.
- **Time-Saving Shortcuts**: Use quick option to make group and sort selections or to reset them.
