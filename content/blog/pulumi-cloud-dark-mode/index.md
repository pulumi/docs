[Pulumi Cloud](/product/pulumi-cloud/) helps teams manage and operate their cloud infrastructure in one place, from state and secrets to deployments, visibility, and policy enforcement.

For a long time, one request has consistently come up from the Pulumi community: dark mode. Today, we’re announcing that this request is now available in Pulumi Cloud.

## Light mode and dark mode

Pulumi Cloud supports light mode, dark mode, and a system default setting that follows your operating system preferences. You can switch themes at any time from your account settings.

Light mode remains the default experience. Dark mode uses lighter text and UI elements on a darker background, which many users prefer for extended sessions or low-light environments.

This update is enabled by recent work from our User Experience team to introduce a shared design system across Pulumi Cloud. With that foundation in place, theming can now be applied consistently across pages and features.

## How to enable dark mode

You can update your theme from your Account Settings at any time.

Select your profile image in the top-right corner of the Pulumi Cloud UI and navigate to **Account Settings**. In the **Preferences** section, choose the theme you want to use:

- Light mode
- Dark mode
- System default
