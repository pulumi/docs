The latest major release of the Pulumi Google Cloud Provider is available now!
Our 8.0 release contains the [latest upstream changes](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/releases/tag/v6.0.0) to keep you up-to-date along with the latest features and improvements from Pulumi.

The Pulumi Google Cloud provider can be used to provision any of the Google Cloud resources available in the upstream provider.
The provider is open source and available on GitHub so you can always follow along with current issues and developments, or even open your first pull request.

## Looking Back

Since the last major release of this provider, we have continuously shipped improvements to our ecosystem, bringing the latest Pulumi features to your production stack.
We have rolled out an [improved diffing strategy](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform-bridge/issues/1785) and [fixed state upgrades](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform-bridge/pull/2081) in the Pulumi Terraform Bridge, removing spurious diffs on preview and increasing confidence when deploying.
Additionally we have improved accuracy and coverage for registry documentation, via [better example conversion](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-gcp/pull/1266) and [general docs improvements for bridged providers](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform-bridge/issues/1794).

## Whatâ€™s New in 8.0

### Added Deletion Protections

Several resources have new `deletionProtection` fields:

- gcp.cloudrunv2.Service
- gcp.cloudrunv2.Job
- gcp.activedirectory.Domain
- gcp.organizations.Folder
- gcp.organizations.Project

Find the documentation for any of these resources in our [registry](https://pulumi.com/registry/packages/gcp)

### New default provisioning label

A new default label, `goog-pulumi-provisioned` lets you discover your Pulumi-provisioned resources in the GCP console
to help you track resources and how they were created.
This label is available as an Output only and can be disabled in your provider configuration.
