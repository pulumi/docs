## Whatâ€™s New in 8.0

### Looking Back

Since the last major release of this provider, we have continuously shipped improvements to our ecosystem, bringing the latest Pulumi features to your production stack.
We have rolled out an improved diffing strategy in the Pulumi Terraform Bridge, removing spurious diffs on preview and increasing confidence when deploying.
Additionally we have worked hard to improve accuracy and coverage for registry documentation.

### Notable upstream features

Several resources have new `deletionProtection` fields:

- gcp.cloudrunv2.Service
- gcp.cloudrunv2.Job
- gcp.activedirectory.Domain
- gcp.organizations.Folder
- gcp.organizations.Project

A new default label, `goog-pulumi-provisioned` lets you discover your Pulumi-provisioned resources in the GCP console
to help you track resources and how they were created.
This label is available as an Output only and can be disabled in your provider configuration.
