## The Challenges of a Sprawling Software Landscape

{{< youtube "HIliBBo4c-g?rel=0" >}}

[BMW's software journey](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/news/general/2023/BMWGroupIT.html) has been a testament to the exponential growth of automotive technology. What started with simple engine controllers has evolved into a complex network of electronic control units (ECUs) scattered throughout the vehicle. As the software footprint continues to expand, BMW recognized the need for a unified and efficient approach to software development and deployment.

The company's initial efforts involved introducing a platform called "Code Craft," which provided a comprehensive stack of services to support the software development lifecycle. This stack included a GitHub Enterprise application for source code management, a Gerrit system for Android-based developments, a continuous integration (CI) pipeline, artifact stores, build caching, and various other tools and services.

However, as the demand for software-driven features grew, the complexity of managing this sprawling ecosystem became increasingly challenging. BMW found itself grappling with the need to scale its infrastructure, navigate network limitations across multiple data centers, and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of cloud computing.

## The Evolution of BMW's Software Development Toolchain

BMW's journey to streamline its software development process has been gradual and iterative. The company's initial approach involved using [Ansible](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/vs/chef-puppet-etc/) for deployment and a custom-built deployment scripting solution for its OpenShift cluster.

As the complexity of the platform increased, BMW turned to Helm and Kubernetes to manage its containerized services. However, as the company ventured into the public cloud, the limitations of these tools became apparent. The team recognized the need for a more comprehensive and scalable solution to manage their infrastructure as code.

At this critical juncture, BMW discovered Pulumi. This modern IaC solution offered a unique advantage â€“ the ability to leverage a full-fledged programming language, Python, to define and manage their infrastructure. This shift proved to be a game-changer, allowing BMW to leverage its expertise in Python and benefit from the rich ecosystem of libraries and tools available in the Python community.

## Embracing Pulumi: Streamlining Infrastructure Management

[BMW's adoption of Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/case-studies/bmw/) was a strategic move that aimed to address the growing complexity of its software ecosystem. By transitioning from a patchwork of tools to a unified IaC solution, the company was able to streamline its infrastructure management and improve developer productivity.

### Shared Modules: Promoting Reusability and Best Practices

One of BMW's key initiatives was developing a shared modules library, which allowed the team to abstract the complexity of various infrastructure components, such as databases, and provide a consistent and user-friendly interface for their developers.
- By leveraging [Pulumi's Python](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/languages-sdks/python/) bindings, BMW was able to create reusable modules that encapsulated best practices and sensible defaults, making it easier for developers to provision and manage infrastructure resources.
BMW used Pydantic, a data validation library, to define schema-based configurations for its infrastructure. These were then integrated into its IDEs, providing developers with auto-completion and validation support.
- This approach not only accelerated the development process but also ensured that the infrastructure deployed across the organization adhered to consistent security and compliance standards.

### Transformation Features: Protecting Legacy Services

- As part of their software factory, BMW also faced the challenge of integrating legacy services that did not natively support modern authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/oidc/provider/).
- To address this, BMW leveraged Pulumi's transformation features to seamlessly inject an [OAuth2](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/oidc/client/#exchanging-oidc-tokens) proxy into their deployments, providing a secure and consistent way to protect these services without requiring extensive modifications to the underlying applications.
- By encapsulating this functionality within a shared module, BMW was able to apply the OAuth2 proxy to multiple services, ensuring a consistent and secure access control layer across their software ecosystem.

### Policy Enforcement: Ensuring Compliance and Security

One key benefit of [Pulumi's IaC approach](https://www.pulumi.com/product/infrastructure-as-code/) is the ability to define and enforce policies across the organization, ensuring that infrastructure deployments adhere to security and compliance standards.
BMW has leveraged [Pulumi's policy-as-code](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/crossguard/) capabilities to implement mandatory checks, such as ensuring that all S3 buckets are encrypted at rest, preventing the deployment of non-compliant resources.
- By integrating these policy checks into their deployment workflows, BMW has shifted security and compliance concerns to the left, addressing issues early in the development process and reducing the risk of costly post-deployment [remediations](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/remediation-policies/).

## The Benefits of Pulumi: Accelerating Development and Improving Maintainability

BMW's adoption of Pulumi has yielded significant benefits, transforming the way the company approaches software development and infrastructure management.

### Accelerated Development with Shared Modules

The implementation of shared modules has been a game-changer for BMW. It allows developers to leverage pre-built and tested infrastructure components without having to reinvent the wheel. This has resulted in a significant acceleration of the development process, as teams can focus on building their applications rather than grappling with the complexities of infrastructure provisioning.

### Improved Maintainability and Consistency

By centralizing infrastructure management within the shared modules, BMW has ensured that best practices and security standards are consistently applied across the organization. This has not only improved the overall maintainability of the software ecosystem but has also reduced the risk of security and compliance violations.

### Leveraging Python's Ecosystem

BMW's decision to leverage Pulumi's Python bindings has been a strategic advantage, as the company was able to tap into the rich ecosystem of Python libraries and tools. This has enabled the team to seamlessly integrate Pulumi with their existing Python-based toolchain, including dependency management, testing frameworks, and code quality tools, further enhancing the development experience.
