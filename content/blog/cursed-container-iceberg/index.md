In the world of cloud computing, running containers has become a staple for deploying applications efficiently. While most developers are familiar with standard practices like using Docker on AWS or Kubernetes clusters, there's an entire world of methods lurking beneath the surface. What are the unexpected, and ingenious ways you can run OCI (Open Container Initiative) containers today on the cloud.

<!--more-->

We'll explore these methods using the iceberg meme as our guide. The iceberg represents knowledge depth, with the most common and obvious methods at the tip, and the more obscure, hidden techniques lying deeper below the surface. Get ready to journey from the familiar to the fantastically unconventional.

## Constraints

Before diving in, clarify the criteria that each method meets:

**Technically Possible Today:** Each method can be implemented now using existing technologies and platforms, though they might require some creativity or complex setups.

**Runs OCI Containers:** All solutions involve running containers that adhere to the OCI specification, ensuring they're genuine containers—not simulated environments.

**Doable from Your Computer Today:** You can set up these methods now, from your computer, possibly with just a credit card and some ingenuity.
And then everything _after_ that comment will appear on the post page itself.
