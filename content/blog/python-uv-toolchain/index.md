Continuing our work to bring [the best of modern Python to Infrastructure as Code](/blog/pulumi-loves-python/), we are excited to announce built-in support for [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) in Pulumi. uv is an extremely fast Python package manager that can install dependencies up to 100x faster than traditional tools, providing one of the fastest ways to manage your Python dependencies and virtual environments.

## Why uv?

Listen in on this discussion between [Adam Gordon Bell](/blog/author/adam-gordon-bell/) and [Julien Poissonnier](/blog/author/julien-poissonnier/) as they discuss Pulumi + uv and why uv is so fast!
{{< youtube "hxi7ZL9H0IU?rel=0" >}}

uv brings several key advantages to your Python development workflow:

- **Blazing Fast Performance**: Written in Rust, uv can install packages 10-100x faster than pip
- **Reliable Dependency Resolution**: Advanced resolution algorithm ensures consistent environments
- **Drop-in Replacement**: Works seamlessly with existing requirements.txt and pyproject.toml files
- **Built-in Virtual Environment Management**: Simplified environment handling out of the box

## Using uv in Pulumi

To use uv to manage your Python virtual environment and dependencies, set the `toolchain` option to `uv` in your `Pulumi.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: uv-goes-brrrr
runtime:
  name: python
  options:
    toolchain: uv
    virtualenv: .venv
```

If you have uv installed, you can run `pulumi new python` and select uv as the toolchain to use for installing dependencies and running the program.

You can find more information on how to use uv in Pulumi in our [Python documentation](/docs/iac/languages-sdks/python/#uv).
