The [Pulumi Docker Containers](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-docker-containers) provide a convenient way for running Pulumi in CI/CD pipelines, or for running Pulumi in environments where you don't want to install the Pulumi CLI directly. These images also power [Pulumi Deployments](/product/pulumi-deployments/). We provide several flavors of images, including the [pulumi/pulumi](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi/tags) image that includes all supported language runtimes in a single image, as well as slim images for each language runtime, for example [pulumi/pulumi-python](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi-python/tags) or [pulumi/pulumi-nodejs](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi-nodejs/tags).

To provide more flexibility for choosing the version of the programming language to use, we have added versioned images for the language specific images covering [all of our supported languages](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi?tab=readme-ov-file#languages). We now also support setting the version of the Node.js and Python runtimes used in Pulumi Deployments by using `.node-version` and `.python-version` files.

<!--more-->

For Python we provide images for [Python 3.9 to 3.12](https://hub.docker.com/u/pulumi?page=1&search=pulumi-python), for Node.js we have images for [Node.js 18, 20 and 22](https://hub.docker.com/u/pulumi?page=1&search=pulumi-nodejs), and for .NET we have images for [.NET 6.0 and 8.0](https://hub.docker.com/u/pulumi?page=1&search=pulumi-dotnet). These versioned images include the language version in the image name, for example [pulumi/pulumi-python-3.12](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi-python-3.12/tags) or [pulumi/pulumi-nodejs-22](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi-nodejs-22/tags).

The Go image is not versioned, as the Go runtime natively supports multiple versions via its [Go Toolchains](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain) feature. The `go` statement in your Pulumi project's `go.mod` file determines the Go version used to compile your program.

### Updating the Default Language Versions

In **November 2024** the images without a version suffix, like [pulumi/pulumi-python](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi-python/tags), and the [pulumi/pulumi](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi) image, will be updated to use the latest versions for each of the language runtimes by default:

| Language Runtime | Current Version | New Version |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| .NET             | 6.0             | 8.0         |
| Go               | 1.21            | 1.23        |
| Node.js          | 18              | 22          |
| Python           | 3.9             | 3.13        |
| Java             | 17              | 21          |

The default versions will be updated as new versions of the language runtimes are released, matching the [versions supported by the Pulumi CLI](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi?tab=readme-ov-file#languages).  This will enable the unversioned [pulumi/pulumi](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi/tags) image to stay evergreen as new runtimes come into and out of support.

The [pulumi-provider-build-environment](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi-provider-build-environment/tags) image, which is useful for building Pulumi providers, will also be updated with the latest language runtimes, as well as upgrading [GoReleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser) from v1 to v2. See the [upgrade instructions](https://goreleaser.com/blog/goreleaser-v2/#upgrading) on how to migrate your configuration to v2.

If you require a specific version of a language runtime, you can use the versioned images. If you want to use the latest versions of the language runtimes, you can use the images without a version suffix.

### Setting the Language Version in Pulumi Deployments

When developing Node.js and Python programs, it is common to use a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage the version of the runtime used in your development environment. These tools use a `.node-version` or `.python-version` file to specify the version of the runtime to use in the current directory.

Using the latest version of the [pulumi/pulumi](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi/tags) image, Pulumi Deployments now supports these files to set the version of the Node.js and Python runtimes used in the Deployment environment. For example, to use Node.js 22 in a Deployment, you can add a `.node-version` file to your project with the content `22`. The Deployment will then use Node.js 22 to run your Pulumi program.

{{% notes type="info" %}}
The [pulumi/pulumi](https://hub.docker.com/r/pulumi/pulumi/tags) image ships with Node.js 18, 20 and 22 pre-installed, as well as Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12. Only the latest patch release of these versions is pre-installed, and it is therefore recommended you only specify the major version in the `.node-version` and `.python-version` files. If you provide a more specific version that does not match any of the pre-installed versions, it will be downloaded and installed on demand for each Deployment run.

To support more flexibility for .NET versions, the default image now also ships both .NET 6.0 and 8.0, allowing you to specify the version of .NET used in a deployment in the `TargetFramework` property in your project's `.csproj` or `.fsproj` file.

```xml
﻿<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    ...
```

If you want to use one of the language specific images, or your own custom built image, you can [set a custom executor image](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments/reference/#customizing-the-deployment-environment) in the Deployment settings.

### Additional Tools

We recently added [native Poetry support](/blog/pulumi-loves-python/#native-support-for-poetry) to Pulumi, and all of our images that include Python now ship with Poetry pre-installed. Images that include Node.js now ship with pnpm pre-installed.

To use Poetry set the [`toolchain` runtime option](/docs/iac/concepts/projects/project-file/#runtime-options) to `poetry`:

```yaml
name: pulumi-and-poetry-are-best-friends
runtime:
  name: python
  options:
    toolchain: poetry
```

To use pnpm set the [`packagemanager` runtime option](/docs/iac/concepts/projects/project-file/#runtime-options) to `pnpm`:

```yaml
name: pulumi-and-pnpm-sitting-in-a-tree
runtime:
  name: nodejs
  options:
    packagemanager: pnpm
```

These options work everywhere you run Pulumi, be it by directly running the Pulumi CLI locally, in CI/CD pipelines using our docker images, in GitHub Actions using the [Pulumi Action](https://github.com/pulumi/actions), or in Pulumi Deployments.

### Conclusion

These updates ensure that you get the latest version of the language runtimes by default, and provide more flexibility for choosing a specific version of the language runtime in your Pulumi projects and Deployments when required. Pulumi Deployments now also ship with Poetry and pnpm pre-installed, making it easier to use these tools in your Pulumi projects.
