Pulumi enables teams to manage their infrastructure using the programming languages and tools they are already familiar with, supporting use cases such as complex authentication workflows, dynamically configured resources, and more.

In this post we're excited to announce an improvement to the `pulumi refresh` and `pulumi destroy` commands: the `--run-program` flag! This new feature makes Pulumi even more powerful for teams with complex infrastructure workflows.

<!--more-->

This enhancement is particularly valuable for teams working with short-lived credentials, dynamic resources, or any workflow where your code needs to run to establish the right context. Whether you're using OIDC-based authentication, dynamically fetching credentials from a secrets manager, or working with [dynamic providers](/docs/iac/concepts/resources/dynamic-providers), the `--run-program` flag ensures your infrastructure operations have the context they need to succeed.

The `pulumi refresh` and `pulumi destroy` commands sit alongside `pulumi up` and support refreshing and destroying resources in your stack. While `refresh` and `destroy` take into account updated configuration (such as that specified in your `Pulumi.<stack>.yaml`), they have historically not taken into account changes in your *code*. For stacks which depend on code to update credentials for a provider, or to determine which resources to create, this can break or hamper the use of `refresh` and `destroy`. Well, no more! As of the latest release of Pulumi (v3.160.0), the `pulumi refresh` and `pulumi destroy` commands now support the `--run-program` flag, which allows you to run your program before refreshing or destroying your stack.

We plan to make running your program the default behavior for refresh and destroy operations eventually. We're introducing this as an opt-in flag first to ensure a smooth transition. For more details and to provide feedback, please see our [RFC on making program execution the default behavior](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/discussions/19102).

## Let's see it in action

We are writing a Pulumi program to deploy infrastructure to AWS. Our organization's platform team provides us with a library that we can use to dynamically fetch appropriate AWS credentials for our stack. We use this to retrieve some values and set up an explicit AWS provider ([1](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/disable-default-providers/), [2](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/resources/providers/), [3](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/api-docs/provider/)):

We run `pulumi up` and everything works as we expect -- our program grabs the appropriate tokens and sets up our S3 bucket.

A few days, weeks, months, or even years later, we find that some tweaks have been made to the bucket in the AWS console. Before we update and re-run our program, we want to refresh Pulumi's state so that it picks up the current properties of the bucket. We run `pulumi refresh` and, after waiting a while... it fails! What has gone wrong?

The issue is that our program needs to run to fetch the latest credentials using our platform team's library. However, `pulumi refresh` doesn't run our program by default. To fix this, we can use the new `--run-program` flag:

```shell
pulumi refresh --run-program
```

This time, Pulumi will run our program before refreshing the state of our stack. As a result, our program will fetch the latest credentials using the library provided by our platform team, and everything will work as expected! If in a few months we need to clean up our stack, `pulumi destroy` also accepts the new option:

```shell
pulumi destroy --run-program
```

## What's next?

Running the program for all Pulumi operations paves the way for several other highly-requested features. Top of our list is [lifecycle hooks](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/1691) -- the ability to run arbitrary program code at various points in the lifecycle of a Pulumi resource.

{{% notes %}}
As mentioned earlier, we plan to make the behavior of `--run-program` the default in a future release. This means that Pulumi will automatically run your program before refresh and destroy operations, without requiring the flag. For more details and to provide feedback, please see our [RFC on making program execution the default behavior for refresh and destroy](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/discussions/19102).
