    See how the tap-pulumi-cloud extractor helps you export your Pulumi data into your own Data Warehouse.
    We show how you can use this connector to download Pulumi Cloud data into any destination of your choice; helping you to track infrastructure metrics alongside the rest of your data.

Integrating various infrastructure data sources into your data warehouse has long been a challenge for Platform Teams. Whether it’s dealing with multiple API endpoints, managing complex authentication processes, or just trying to get a consistent, reliable data feed, the process can be daunting and time-consuming. Especially when you factor in the various cloud providers, and the inconsistency in data formats across them all.

These pain points can slow down your ability to get actionable insights from your infrastructure data, leaving you with more questions than answers.

The [tap-pulumi-cloud connector](https://github.com/pulumi/tap-pulumi-cloud), announced today, is designed to address these challenges head-on by offering a simple solution for automating the process of accessing infrastructure data.
<!--more-->
Leveraging Pulumi Cloud data about your infrastructure instead of going directly to the provider eliminates the need for custom API integrations and handles the data consistency problem. And while all this data existed before today, by using the [Pulumi Cloud console](https://app.pulumi.com) or [Pulumi Cloud REST API](/docs/pulumi-cloud/cloud-rest-api) directly, the `tap-pulumi-cloud` connector handles complex interactions with the API, transforming the raw data into a structured format that’s ready for analysis as soon as it lands in your data warehouse. This means less time spent on data wrangling and more time on generating insights.

A few examples of the types of analytics you can build on top Pulumi Cloud data:

1. Average resources under management overtime [(code example)](#see-average-resources-under-management)
2. The average time to deploy changes [(code example)](#see-the-average-time-to-deploy-changes)
3. See the total updates per user [(code example)](#see-the-total-updates-per-user)
4. Join with CI/CD provider data to generate DORA metrics and reporting
5. Join with resource cost data to generate infrastructure cost reporting

As it is built on the [Meltano SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/index.html), you can use [tap-pulumi-cloud](https://github.com/pulumi/tap-pulumi-cloud) with loaders such as [target-snowflake](https://hub.meltano.com/loaders/target-snowflake), [target-bigquery](https://hub.meltano.com/loaders/target-bigquery), [target-redshift](https://hub.meltano.com/loaders/target-redshift) or even [target-postgres](https://hub.meltano.com/loaders/target-postgres); allowing us to load the data into our own data warehouse easily.

## Set up

Firstly, set up your environment [by following Meltano's installation guide](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/installation-guide). Once this is done, continue by adding `tap-pulumi-cloud` and your choice of loader into your environment, we'll use `target-duckdb` for this example:

```bash
meltano add extractor tap-pulumi-cloud
meltano add loader target-duckdb
```

Then switch your tap variant to use Pulumi's instead of the default, open meltano.yml and change the pip_url to `git+https://github.com/pulumi/tap-pulumi-cloud.git`

```yml
version: 1
default_environment: dev
project_id: be90b150-3e48-4ecd-be9d-161ef7417e3c
environments:
- name: dev
- name: staging
- name: prod
plugins:
  extractors:
  - name: tap-pulumi-cloud
    variant: meltanolabs
    pip_url: git+https://github.com/pulumi/tap-pulumi-cloud.git
  loaders:
  - name: target-duckdb
    variant: jwills
    pip_url: target-duckdb~=0.6
```

Then run `meltano install` to make sure the right version is installed.

## Configure it

To configure all settings available for this tap, you can use Meltano's interactive config running:

```bash
meltano config tap-pulumi-cloud set --interactive
```

The required variables are the `token` [(Get one from Pulumi Cloud)](https://app.pulumi.com/) and `organizations` is a list of Pulumi Cloud organizations you want to extract data from.

## Load data

When your configuration has been finished, you can run the data pipeline:

```bash
meltano run tap-pulumi-cloud target-duckdb
```

After the run finishes, you can access the exported tables and create whichever analytics you need on top of them, for example, you could combine this dataset with [tap-github](https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/tap-github) in order to calculate DORA Metrics.

## Orchestration

Once you have this working, you'll need to establish some way of running this regularly in an automated fashion, to keep the data fresh. A popular way to do this is to use an orchestration tool such as [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/) or [Mage](https://www.mage.ai/), among others. An easy way to set up Meltano to run in this way is to use [a Docker container with your Meltano project.](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/containerization/). Another option is to use [Arch which is based on Meltano](https://arch.dev/), which path you choose will depend on your requirements and existing stack.

Since each table is created with primary keys, when the process is run again, each run will "upsert" (update+insert) new data, replacing rows which match the same primary keys; e.g. stream Stacks has a primary key by `org_name, project_name and stack_name`, so if the same combination of keys arrives in the next update, the row will be updated instead of a new row being inserted.

If building a landing zone with all historical changes instead of just the current status, this behavior might not be the desired one, to ignore primary keys and only insert new data, you can add this setting to meltano.yml on the plugin configuration for tap-pulumi-cloud:

```yml
    metadata:
      '*':
        table-key-properties: []
        key-properties: []
```

## Generate metrics

With all of the data in one place, you can generate metrics based on Pulumi Cloud data, and combine it with other data sources, for example if you wanted to look at your average Resources Under Management (RUM) monthly (Using DuckDB's SQL Flavor, adjust to your specific database):

### See average resources under management

```sql
WITH monthly_rum_average AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', MAKE_DATE(CAST(year AS INT), CAST(month AS INT), CAST(day AS INT))) AS rum_month,
        org_name,
        AVG(resources) AS monthly_avg_rum
    FROM
        pulumicloud.daily_rum_usage
    GROUP BY
        rum_month, org_name
)
SELECT
    rum_month,
    org_name,
    monthly_avg_rum,
    LAG(monthly_avg_rum) OVER (ORDER BY rum_month) AS previous_month_avg_rum,
    CASE
        WHEN LAG(monthly_avg_rum) OVER (ORDER BY rum_month) IS NULL THEN NULL
        ELSE ((monthly_avg_rum - LAG(monthly_avg_rum) OVER (ORDER BY rum_month)) / LAG(monthly_avg_rum) OVER (ORDER BY rum_month)) * 100
    END AS month_over_month_rum_growth_percentage
FROM
    monthly_rum_average
```

### See the average time to deploy changes

If you want to see the average time to deploy changes, excluding console-initiated deploys (Similar to what is tracked for "Lead time for changes"):

```sql
WITH stack_deployments AS (
    SELECT
        CAST(json_extract(jobs, '$[0].started') AS TIMESTAMP) AS start_time,
        CAST(json_extract(jobs, '$[0].last_updated') AS TIMESTAMP) AS end_time,
        initiator
    FROM
        pulumicloud.stack_deployments
    WHERE
        initiator IS NOT NULL
        AND initiator <> 'console'
)
SELECT
    initiator,
    AVG(DATE_DIFF('second', start_time, end_time)) / 60 AS avg_deploy_time_in_minutes
FROM
    stack_deployments
GROUP BY
    initiator
```

### See the total updates per user

```sql
WITH operations_by_members AS (
    SELECT
        org_name,
        REPLACE(CAST(json_extract(requested_by, '$.github_login') AS STRING), '"', '') AS github_login,
        COUNT(*) AS total_updates
    FROM
        pulumicloud.stack_updates
    GROUP BY
        org_name, github_login
    ORDER BY
        total_updates DESC
)
SELECT
    om.org_name,
    om.role,
    om.user_github_login,
    om.user_name,
    obm.total_updates
FROM
    pulumicloud.organization_members om
INNER JOIN
    operations_by_members obm
ON
    om.org_name = obm.org_name
    AND om.user_github_login = obm.github_login
ORDER BY
    total_updates DESC
```
