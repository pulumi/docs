It's the end of 2024, and like everyone, we're counting down until 2025 while looking back at our year. We've had a very exciting year, from unveiling a bold new vision for Pulumi to delivering cutting-edge updates across our Pulumi Cloud.

Here's a look at how Pulumi has grown, evolved, and continued empowering teams worldwide.

## A Unified Vision: The Pulumi Platform

![Placeholder Image](pulumi-platform-vision.png)

This year, Pulumi unveiled a bold new vision for Pulumi—[a comprehensive product suite](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-up-2024/) that extends far beyond infrastructure as code. The Pulumi platform now consists of three core products:

- **[Pulumi IaC](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/)**: Open source infrastructure as code in any programming language. With over 100M downloads, 167% growth in contributions, and industry-leading innovations, Pulumi IaC continues to redefine cloud automation.
- **[Pulumi ESC](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/)**: Centralized secrets management and orchestration that scales. General availability this year brought features like SDKs, versioning, tagging, and integrations with 1Password and Kubernetes secrets operators.
- **[Pulumi Insights](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/insights/)**: Visibility, intelligence, and control over all infrastructure resources. Insights 2.0 expanded support for resources created outside Pulumi IaC, delivering advanced graph visualizations and policy enforcement powered by Pulumi CrossGuard.

Three core capabilities unite these products:

- **[Pulumi Copilot](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/copilot/)**: Generative AI is used to manage cloud resources.
- **[Pulumi CrossGuard](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/using-pulumi/crossguard/)**: A policy-as-code engine for compliance and best practices.
- **[Pulumi Deployments](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments/)**: Infrastructure task orchestration.

Over 3,000 customers, including Nvidia, BMW, Unity Games, and Tivity Health, leveraged these solutions to enhance velocity, save costs, and secure their infrastructure.
