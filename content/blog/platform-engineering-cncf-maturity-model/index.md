## CNCF Platform Working Group

Within the CNCF, the Platform Working Group is a collaborative effort focused on the critical topic of cloud native platforms. As a member of this working group, I have the privilege of sharing insights and experiences from our discussions.

The Platform Working Group is part of the CNCF's App Delivery Technical Advisory Group, which also includes initiatives around sustainability, runtime, observability, and security. The working group is open to anyone interested in contributing to the conversation around cloud native platforms, and its members come from a diverse range of backgrounds, including product managers, engineers, and industry experts.

## Defining Cloud Native Platforms

The fundamental question is at the core of the Platform Working Group's efforts: "What exactly is a cloud-native platform, and why do organizations need one?"

To address this, the working group has produced a comprehensive white paper that delves into the definition and value of cloud native platforms. The key takeaway is that a cloud-native platform is not just a collection of tools or technologies but a strategic business initiative enabling organizations to deliver value more efficiently and effectively.

The white paper outlines several key characteristics of a successful cloud-native platform:

- Vendor-neutrality: A cloud-native platform should be open and agnostic, allowing organizations to leverage a wide range of technologies and services without being locked into a single vendor.
- Scalability and flexibility: The platform should be designed to accommodate the growing and changing needs of the organization, with the ability to add or remove components as required easily.
- Developer-centricity: The platform should empower developers to be more productive by providing self-service capabilities, streamlined workflows, and a consistent developer experience.
- Operational efficiency: The platform should simplify and automate the management and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure, allowing the organization to focus on delivering value to customers.
- Continuous improvement: The platform should be designed with a mindset of continuous evolution, with regular updates and enhancements to address emerging needs and technologies.
  
By aligning the platform with these key principles, organizations can unlock significant value, including faster time-to-market, improved developer productivity, and reduced operational overhead.

## The Platform Maturity Model: Charting the Path to Platform Success

Building on the foundation of the white paper, the Platform Working Group has developed a Platform Maturity Model - a framework that helps organizations assess the current state of their cloud native platform and identify the steps needed to reach a higher level of maturity.

The Platform Maturity Model defines five distinct levels of platform maturity, each with its own characteristics and considerations:

- Ad-hoc: At the lowest level, the platform is ad-hoc, with no dedicated team or budget, and a reliance on individual efforts and workarounds.
- Operational: The platform has a dedicated team and budget, but the focus is primarily on operational tasks and maintenance, rather than strategic initiatives.
- Scalable: The platform is now viewed as a product, with a clear roadmap and a focus on delivering value to internal customers. The platform team has more autonomy and the ability to drive innovation.
- Enabled: The platform has become a strategic asset, with a thriving ecosystem of contributors and consumers. The platform team is empowered to make decisions and drive the platform's evolution.
- Optimized: The platform is continuously optimized, with a strong focus on measuring and improving key performance indicators. The platform is deeply integrated into the organization's overall technology strategy and decision-making processes.

By using the Platform Maturity Model as a guide, organizations can assess their current level of platform maturity, identify areas for improvement, and develop a roadmap to reach a higher level of platform success. This model has proven to be a valuable tool for many organizations, helping them to align their platform initiatives with their broader business objectives.

## Platforms as Products: Driving Platform Success

One of the key initiatives currently underway within the Platform Working Group is the "Platforms as Products" research project. This effort aims to explore the parallels between traditional product management and the management of cloud native platforms, with the goal of identifying best practices and patterns that can help organizations unlock the full potential of their platforms.

The core premise of the "Platforms as Products" initiative is that successful cloud native platforms should be treated and managed like products, rather than just technology projects. This means applying principles of product management, such as:

- Defining a clear vision and roadmap: Establishing a long-term vision for the platform and a roadmap to get there, focusing on delivering value to internal customers.
- Measuring and optimizing for key metrics: Identifying and tracking the right performance indicators to ensure the platform is delivering the desired outcomes.
- Fostering a thriving ecosystem: Encouraging and enabling a community of contributors and consumers to drive the platform's evolution and adoption.
- Continuously iterating and improving: Embracing a continuous improvement mindset, with regular updates and enhancements to the platform based on user feedback and emerging needs.

By adopting a product management approach to their cloud native platforms, organizations can better align their platform initiatives with their broader business goals, and ensure that the platform is delivering tangible value to the organization.

The "Platforms as Products" research project is currently underway, with the Platform Working Group conducting interviews and gathering insights from organizations that have successfully implemented cloud native platforms. The goal is to distill these learnings into a set of best practices and patterns that can be shared with the broader community.

## Conclusion

If you're interested in learning more about platform engineering and getting involved in its initiatives, there are several ways to participate:

- Attend the bi-weekly CNCF Platform Working Group meetings: Regular sync meetings are held every other Tuesday at 5 PM Berlin time (11 AM ET).
- Join the CNCF Slack channel: The Platform Working Group has an active presence on the CNCF Slack, where members discuss ideas, share resources, and collaborate on various initiatives.
- I wish there was a doc page to send them to... check other blog
- Join the workshop something something
