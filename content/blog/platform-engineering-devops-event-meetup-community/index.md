## Upcoming In-Person Events

Pulumi is hosting in-person meetups and virtual workshops for engineers interested in Platform Engineering and DevOps, covering topics from best practices to setup and implementation to advanced topics. Join us for tech talks, hands-on workshops, and opportunities to network with fellow engineers.

### First Platform Engineering & DevOps in-person event: Berlin - July 16

Join [Dominik Kress](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-kress-33a540174/) (Product Manager at Giant Swarm and member of the CNCF Platforms Working Group) and [Guy Menahem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guy-menahem/) (Solutions Architect at Komodor and community leader at The Platformers) at LOBE Block for an engaging discussion on platform engineering.

- Dominik Kress will present "What the Heck is the CNCF Platform Working Group? Answers from a Member!"
- Guy Menahem will present "For This Backstage, You Donâ€™t Need a Special Pass: Platform Engineering in Practice."

For more details and to RSVP, visit the [Berlin Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/berlin-pulumi-user-group/events/301456990/).

### Second In-Person Event: Boston, July 24
