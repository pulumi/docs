As we close out 2018, and enter into
a New Year, I was reflecting on our progress here at Pulumi this past year and wanted to share some thoughts.
It’s been an incredible year and we are hugely thankful to our passionate community, customers, and
partners.

Here are some of the exciting things that happened:

**Launching our open source
community.** After being hard at work for a little over a year,
[we launched our open source project]({{< prelref "/blog/introducing-pulumi-a-cloud-development-platform" >}}),
with the aim of making it considerably easier and more enjoyable to create and operate
cloud software. This was a major moment for us. We had previously only shown Pulumi to a few select friends,
family, and private beta users, and the reception was beyond our wildest expectations. We got passionate +1’s
from cloud engineers of all roles and responsibilities -- developers, infrastructure engineers, operators, and
managers alike. The Pulumi community has since grown to thousands of users across hundreds of companies of all
sizes spread across the globe. The community is now a warm, welcoming, and collaborative place with significant
open source contributions and passionate community leaders emerging who are helping one another while also
helping us to make Pulumi even better.

**Support for major public, private, and hybrid clouds.** We launched with support for the three major public
clouds, [AWS]({{< prelref "/docs/get-started/aws" >}}), [Azure]({{< prelref "/docs/get-started/azure" >}}), and
[Google Cloud]({{< prelref "/docs/get-started/gcp" >}}), and have since added capabilities across all
of them, including adding [serverless]({{< prelref "/docs/tutorials/aws/rest-api" >}}),
[containers](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/blob/master/aws-ts-containers/index.ts), and
[infrastructure](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/blob/master/aws-js-webserver/index.js)
productivity libraries -- it is here where we believe Pulumi’s unique approach of using general purpose languages truly
shines. We immediately had a wave of inbound interest in applying the Pulumi approach to infrastructure as code in other
areas, and quickly added other providers including OpenStack, VMWare vSphere, Alibaba Cloud, F5 BigIP, and more. In
September, we unveiled [a native Kubernetes provider]({{< prelref "/docs/get-started/kubernetes" >}}) with support for the
entire API surface area across all versions, plus an operations tool, [KubeSpy](https://github.com/pulumi/kubespy) --
both of which continue to lead to significant community growth. Many customers are loving that they can achieve a
consistent engineering workflow across multi-cloud environments -- often spanning public, private, and/or hybrid clouds.

**Launching our commercial SaaS product.** In October, [we launched our commercial SaaS
product]({{< prelref "/blog/building-a-future-of-cloud-engineering" >}}), with reasonable
[pricing]({{< prelref "/pricing" >}}) so that teams of all sizes are able to get their code to the cloud
productively, securely, and collaboratively. If Pulumi is like Git -- a local CLI and SDK -- then the Pulumi SaaS is
like GitHub -- a hosted service to ensure you can use Pulumi in a team setting. In addition to the Team Edition, which
is meant for the “Fortune 500,000,” we also launched the Enterprise Edition, for the Fortune 500. We already have
multiple Fortune 500 customers moving into production with Pulumi, and expect this to be a significant area of future
growth. Since launching, we’ve added support for more identity providers -- including GitHub, GitLab, and SSO/SAML (for
Okta, ADFs, and others) -- as well as team management capabilities, such as RBAC, our GitHub App, GitHub Actions
partnership, and more.

**Closing our Series A funding.** Also in October, [we secured $15MM in additional
funds](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/pulumi-raises-15m-series-funding-round-launches-multicloud-app-deployment-service/),
which will enable us to scale to meet the incredible opportunity in front of us. The funds will ensure that our open
source projects are constantly improving and achieving production quality; that our commercial product can meet the most
rigorous business requirements, small or large; and that we can grow our organization in areas necessary to meet our
customers’ needs. When we set out to make it 10x easier for teams to do cloud engineering, we saw many facets in need of
attention, and these funds will help us take concrete steps towards realizing the vision.

What an incredible year! It can still hardly believe it’s been just six months since launching.

As we look to 2019, we plan to continue engaging with and growing our open source community, built on the same tenets of openness and collaboration -- the best part of
my job. We have heard loud and clear that what customers need today are solutions, not just raw technologies, and we
will continue to deliver commercial value in our Team and Enterprise Edition SaaS products that cloud engineering
easier, more secure, and more collaborative.

We are just getting started and we can’t wait to continue on the journey of
reimagining cloud engineering together. Thank you for your passionate support -- and here’s to a wonderful 2019!
