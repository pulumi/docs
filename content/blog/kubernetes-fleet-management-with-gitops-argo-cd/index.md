## Challenges in Kubernetes Fleet Management

Imagine Learning encountered several roadblocks in managing their Kubernetes environments:

- **Limited visibility** into the current state of clusters, making it difficult to track and maintain consistency.
- **Fragmented deployment workflows** with multiple pipelines depending on the resource type.
- **High learning curve**, requiring developers to master an additional language for infrastructure provisioning.

These challenges are common among enterprises scaling Kubernetes, highlighting the need for a GitOps-enabled, automated, and developer-friendly solution.

## Implementing the GitOps Bridge Pattern with Pulumi

To streamline Kubernetes fleet management, Imagine Learning adopted the GitOps bridge pattern, integrating Pulumi for infrastructure as code (IaC) and Argo CD for Kubernetes environment synchronization. This approach ensured infrastructure and application configurations remained consistent and automated.

### How the GitOps Bridge Pattern Works

The core of Imagine Learning's solution lies in the GitOps bridge pattern, which connects their infrastructure code (managed by Pulumi) with their Kubernetes environments (managed by Argo CD). Here's how it works:

- **Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi**: Imagine Learning uses Pulumi to define their infrastructure resources, such as AWS VPCs, EKS clusters, and other platform-specific resources, in their preferred programming language (in this case, TypeScript).
- **Bridging to Kubernetes**: Once the infrastructure resources are created, Imagine Learning takes the relevant outputs from their Pulumi code (e.g., IAM role ARNs) and pushes them into a Kubernetes Secret managed by Argo CD. This secret serves as the bridge between their infrastructure code and their Kubernetes environments.
- **GitOps with Argo CD**: Argo CD, a popular GitOps tool, picks up the changes in the Kubernetes Secret and automatically reconciles the desired state in the Kubernetes clusters, ensuring that the infrastructure and application configurations are in sync.
- **Automated Deployments with GitHub Actions**: Every Git merge triggers a Pulumi deployment that updates the Kubernetes Secret. Argo CD then detects the changes and applies them to the Kubernetes clusters.

This GitOps bridge pattern allows Imagine Learning to maintain a single source of truth for its infrastructure and application configurations. This ensures consistency and reliability across its Kubernetes environments, eliminates manual interventions, and reduces deployment risks.

## Why Imagine Learning Chose Pulumi

Imagine Learning selected Pulumi for its developer-first approach to Kubernetes fleet management, offering:

- **Familiar Programming Languages**—Pulumi allows developers to write infrastructure code in the same programming languages they use for their application code, such as TypeScript, Python, or Go. This reduces the need to learn domain-specific languages, reducing the cognitive load and context-switching required, enabling the team to be more productive.
- **Code Reusability** – Teams can manage multiple stacks (environments) with different configurations using the same codebase, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
- **Powerful Abstractions** – Pulumi provides powerful abstractions, such as the Crosswalk for AWS library, which encapsulates best practices for deploying resources like VPCs and EKS clusters. This allows the Imagine Learning team to focus on the high-level infrastructure design rather than the low-level details.
- **Seamless GitOps Integration** – ulumi's integration with Git and GitHub enables Imagine Learning to leverage the GitOps bridge pattern, where their infrastructure code is the source of truth and automatically deployed through GitHub Actions.
- **Visibility and Auditability** – The Pulumi UI provides a clear history of infrastructure changes, allowing the team to easily understand and review the history of their deployments.

## Technical Implementation of the GitOps Bridge Pattern

Let's dive into the technical implementation of Imagine Learning's GitOps bridge pattern using Pulumi.

{{< youtube "1Q3XPmenthg?rel=0" >}}

See the implementation examples below and [explore the demo code](https://github.com/blakeromano/gitops-bridge-demo) provided by Blake Romano, Imagine Learning.

### Defining Infrastructure with Pulumi

Imagine Learning uses Pulumi to define its infrastructure resources, such as VPCs and EKS clusters. Here's an example of how they create a VPC using the Crosswalk for AWS library:

```
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
import * as awsx from "@pulumi/awsx";

const vpc = new awsx.network.VPC("main-vpc", {
    cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16",
    numberOfAvailabilityZones: 3,
    natGatewayStrategy: "single_nat_gateway",
});
...
```

### Updating Kubernetes Configurations Dynamically

Imagine Learning also uses Pulumi to dynamically update Kubernetes resources based on the infrastructure they've created. For example, they update the AWS EKS ConfigMap with the IAM role ARN created in their Pulumi code:

```
const eksConfigMap = new k8s.core.v1.ConfigMap("eks-config-map", {
    metadata: { name: "aws-auth", namespace: "kube-system" },
    data: { mapRoles: JSON.stringify([{ rolearn: eksCluster.roleArn, username: "system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}}", groups: ["system:bootstrappers", "system:nodes"] }]) }
});
...
```

### Bridging to Kubernetes with Argo CD

To bridge the gap between their infrastructure code and Kubernetes, Imagine Learning uses Argo CD to manage a Kubernetes secret that contains the relevant metadata from their Pulumi deployments. Here's an example of how they create this secret:

```
const clusterSecret = new k8s.core.v1.Secret("cluster-secret", {
metadata: {
name: "cluster-secret",
annotations: {
"pulumi.com/secret": "true",
"pulumi.com/secret-encryption-context": JSON.stringify({
"pulumi:project": pulumi.getProject(),
"pulumi:stack": pulumi.getStack(),
}),
},
},
type: "Opaque",
stringData: {
"eks-cluster-name": eksCluster.name,
"eks-cluster-arn": eksCluster.arn,
"eks-cluster-endpoint": eksCluster.endpoint,
"eks-cluster-certificate-authority": eksCluster.certificateAuthority.data,
},
}, { provider: k8s.provider });
...
```

In this example, Imagine Learning is creating a Kubernetes secret that contains the relevant metadata from their EKS cluster deployment, such as the cluster name, ARN, endpoint, and certificate authority. They use Pulumi's GitHub provider to manage this secret in a Git repository, ensuring that the desired state of their infrastructure is tracked in version control.

### Automating Deployments with GitHub Actions

To streamline their deployment process, Imagine Learning leverages GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of their infrastructure changes. When a pull request is merged into the main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow triggers a Pulumi deployment, which in turn updates the Kubernetes secret in the Git repository. Argo CD then detects the changes and applies them to the Kubernetes clusters.

This automated deployment process allows Imagine Learning to quickly and reliably deploy changes to all of their Kubernetes environments, reducing the manual effort and the risk of inconsistencies between their infrastructure and application configurations.

## Results:  Faster Deployments, Increased Reliability, and Reduced Cognitive Load

Imagine Learning's adoption of the GitOps bridge pattern with Pulumi and Argo CD has transformed their Kubernetes fleet management capabilities:

- Faster Deployments – Kubernetes fleet updates within 5-10 minutes.
- Increased Reliability – Automated validation and change previews improve deployment confidence.
- Reduced Cognitive Load – Developers work in familiar programming languages.
- Seamless GitOps Integration – Infrastructure code remains the single source of truth.
- Automatic Change Propagation – Updates flow effortlessly from Pulumi to Kubernetes clusters.
