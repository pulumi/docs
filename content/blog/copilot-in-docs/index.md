These additions make learning about Pulumi more interactive and intuitive by allowing users to explore cloud infrastructure concepts directly within the documentation through a conversational interface. Whether you’re a seasoned Pulumi user or just starting out, Pulumi Copilot is here to help you when you need it most, where you need it most.

## New Enhancements in Pulumi Copilot

### Expanded Website Integration

Pulumi Copilot is now embedded throughout the Pulumi website, providing contextual assistance no matter where you are. Whether you’re exploring documentation, reading a blog post, browsing the Pulumi registry, or reviewing case studies, Pulumi Copilot offers helpful suggestions, explanations, and links to guide you to relevant resources.

### Pulumi Documentation Skill

The new Documentation Skill is designed to make Pulumi’s docs more accessible from wherever. You can ask questions like "How do I use the dependsOn resource option?" or “How do I use SAML in my organization?" or "How can I store and retrieve secrets using Pulumi ESC?" and Pulumi Copilot will answer them by searching through our documentation on your behalf. This new skill is available everywhere Pulumi Copilot is: in Pulumi Cloud, in Pulumi documentation, across the Pulumi website, and the Registry.
