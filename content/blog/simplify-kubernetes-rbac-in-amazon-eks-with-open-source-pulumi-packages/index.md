title: "Simplify Kubernetes RBAC in Amazon EKS with open source Pulumi packages"
authors: ["nishi-davidson"]
tags: ["TODO"]
date: "2019-04-25"

summary: "One of the most common areas Kubernetes operators struggle with in
production involves creating and managing role-based access control
(RBAC). This is so daunting that RBAC is often not implemented, or
implemented halfway, or the configuration becomes impossible to
maintain. In this post, we will contrast the traditional way of working
with RBAC on EKS with using Pulumi --- Pulumi makes RBAC on Kubernetes
so easy that you'll never create an insecure cluster again!"

This post needs to be reexported. It looks like there was a draft of the post
with nearly identical wording that was uploaded? And/or the post was edited
after it was exported? Regardless, we need to redo the whole Markdown
conversion process for this one.  --Chris
