At Pulumi, we want to provide access to manage **any** cloud infrastructure
with a single unified programming model.  
To that end, we've already added support for [any Terraform/OpenTofu provider](blog/any-terraform-provider/).
This works great if you already have an existing Pulumi project and want to
leverage providers from the Terraform ecosystem that aren't yet available for
Pulumi natively! However, what if you are trying to move your existing
infrastructure as code solution to Pulumi IaC?

We already have a [handy
utility](/docs/using-pulumi/adopting-pulumi/migrating-to-pulumi/from-terraform/)
called `pulumi convert` built into the CLI to convert Terraform projects to any
Pulumi language, but up until now it didn't handle dependencies on external
Terraform providers which don't have a known Pulumi native equivalent.

We're happy to announce that with the release of [Pulumi
3.145](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/releases/tag/v3.145.0), we now support
the same automatic bridging we brought to existing Pulumi projects to projects
being converted from Terraform into Pulumi!

<!--more-->

## Quickstart

If you're anxious to try this out on your own Terraform codebase, you need only
to navigate to your project directory and run the following command with the
latest version of Pulumi installed:

{{% chooser language "javascript,typescript,python,go,yaml" %}}

{{% choosable language javascript %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language nodejs
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language typescript
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language python
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language go
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language yaml
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% /chooser %}}

This will download the necessary plugins, run the conversion and output it in
the current directory, generating all necessary project files.

If all went well you can run `pulumi preview` to see if the project can deploy
successfully. Truth be told, there are still [a few scenarios](#limitations)
where the conversion will succeed but the generated code needs a little bit of
attention before you're off to the races.

## Detailed Example

In order to illustrate the example further, I've thrown together a simple
Terraform project that sets up a Google Compute Engine virtual machine, a
PlanetScale database, and wires them together.  At the time of writing, there
is no PlanetScale provider in the Pulumi registry, and the project will specify
using a specific version of the Terraform provider.

Here is the Terraform code in a single main.tf file:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.1.0"

  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~> 6.0"
    }
    planetscale = {
      source  = "planetscale/planetscale"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  project = var.gcp_project
  region  = var.gcp_region
  zone    = var.gcp_zone
}

provider "planetscale" {
  service_token      = var.planetscale_service_token
  service_token_name = "planetscaletoken"
}

variable "gcp_project" {
  description = "GCP project ID"
  default     = "pulumi-convert-example-gcp-project"
}

variable "gcp_region" {
  description = "GCP region to use"
  default     = "us-central1"
}

variable "gcp_zone" {
  description = "GCP zone"
  default     = "us-central1-a"
}

variable "planetscale_org" {
  description = "PlanetScale organization name"
  default     = "pulumi-convert-planetscale-org"
}

variable "planetscale_service_token" {
  description = "PlanetScale service token secret"
  sensitive   = true
  default     = "test-planetscale-service-token"
}

# Create the PlanetScale database
resource "planetscale_database" "db" {
  name         = "pulumi-convert-db"
  organization = var.planetscale_org
}

# Generate a password for connecting to the DB
resource "planetscale_password" "db_password" {
  organization = "brandonpollack23"
  name         = "terraform-generated"
  database     = planetscale_database.db.name
  branch       = planetscale_database.db.default_branch
}

# Spin up a small GCE VM
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm" {
  name         = "demo-vm"
  machine_type = "e2-micro"
  zone         = var.gcp_zone

  # Minimal Debian boot disk
  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"
    }
  }

  # Use the default VPC with a public IP
  network_interface {
    network = "default"
    access_config {}
  }

  # Pass PlanetScale connection info as metadata
  metadata = {
    DB_HOST = planetscale_database.db.url
    DB_USER = "root"
    DB_PASS = planetscale_password.db_password.plaintext
    DB_NAME = planetscale_database.db.name
  }
}
```

{{% notes type="warning" %}}
**Never** store secrets or keys in plain text in your code or commited
configuration files. I only have a db_password stored here in plain text for
the sake of readability.

Consider using [Pulumi ESC](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/) to store these types of
secrets (and any other configuration!) and access them directly from your Pulumi programs.
{{% /notes %}}

This alone works if you run `terraform plan`, however without *real*
credentials nothing will really deploy, of course! You can set these in `.tfvars`,
environmental variables, command line, etc.  

Even if you use a `.tfvars` file, converting this is not currently supported, so
the configuration will need to be moved to stack files in your
new Pulumi project (eg `Pulumi.dev.yaml`, `Pulumi.prod.yaml`, etc).

You can convert this into a new project with the following command:

{{% chooser language "typescript,python,go,yaml" %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language typescript --out pulumi-ts-program
```

I have opted to output it to a different directory to preserve the contents of my Terraform project.

### Project structure

If we navigate to the `pulumi-ts-program` directory, we can see a few things:

- Pulumi.yaml, the pulumi configuration file.
- index.ts, our equivalent to main.tf for typescript projects.
- sdks directory, where the generated bridged provider is output.
- other node project artifacts such as package.json, node_modules, tsconfig.json, etc..

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language python --out pulumi-python-program
```

I have opted to output it to a different directory to preserve the contents of my Terraform project.

### Project structure

If we navigate to the `pulumi-python-program` directory, we can see a few things:

- Pulumi.yaml, the pulumi configuration file.
- \_\_main\_\_.py, our equivalent to main.tf for python projects.
- sdks directory, where the generated bridged provider is output.
- other python project artifacts (eg requirments.txt, pyproject.toml, etc).

### Python specific cleanup

The python code generator may try to use subscript syntax inappropriately, so you may need to look through the generated code and switch certain things to dot access syntax like so:

```diff
metadata={
-        "DB_HOST": db["url"],
+        "DB_HOST": db.url,
        "DB_USER": "root",
-        "DB_PASS": db_password["plaintext"],
-        "DB_NAME": db["name"],
+        "DB_PASS": db_password.plaintext,
+        "DB_NAME": db.name,
}
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language go --out pulumi-go-program
```

I have opted to output it to a different directory to preserve the contents of my Terraform project.

### Project structure

If we navigate to the `pulumi-go-program` directory, we can see a few things:

- main.go, our equivalent to main.tf for golang projects
- sdks directory, where the generated bridged provider is output
- other golang project artifacts (go.mod, go.sum)

### Go specific cleanup

The go code generator outputs everything in the Terraform code, even if it is
unused. This is an error in a go program, so I had to manually remove
unreferenced variables like GCP project, region, and PlanetScale service token.

These are part of the output because in it's current iteration the code
converter will convert everything, even if ultimately it is provider
configuration (see [cleanup](#cleanup)) and not actual code.

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language yaml --out pulumi-yaml-program
```

I have opted to output it to a different directory to preserve the contents of my Terraform project.

### Project structure

If we navigate to the `pulumi-yaml-program` directory, we can see a few things:

- Pulumi.yaml, the pulumi configuration file.
- Main.yaml, our equivalent to main.tf for golang projects.
- sdks directory, where the generated bridged provider is output.

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% /chooser %}}

### Cleanup

If we simply run `pulumi preview` this project unfortunately won't run right away.  
We need to create our stack configuration that contains the GCP and PlanetScale credentials.

These were part of our `main.tf` file, but the code generator doesn't
distinguish between provider config and code, so we need to handle this
part on our own (for now).

These can go in either your `Pulumi.yaml` or your stack configuration.  Places
for them are already generated, you just need to fill them in:

```yaml
name: terraform-convert-example
runtime: nodejs
config:
  google:project:
    value: 'TODO: var.gcp_project' # fill in here
  google:region:
    value: 'TODO: var.gcp_region'
  google:zone:
    value: 'TODO: var.gcp_zone'
  planetscale:serviceToken:
    value: 'TODO: var.planetscale_service_token'
  planetscale:serviceTokenName:
    value: planetscaletoken
```

Also notice the configuration names differ from the pulumi counterparts "google" should be "gcp".

After filling things in the `Pulumi.yaml` should look something like this:

```yaml
name: terraform-convert-example
runtime: nodejs
config:
  gcp:project:
    value: 'brandonpollack23'
  gcp:region:
    value: 'us-central1'
  gcp:zone:
    value: 'us-central1-a'
  planetscale:serviceToken:
    value: 'supersecrettoken'
  planetscale:serviceTokenName:
    value: planetscaletoken
```

and if you run `pulumi preview` it successfully generates a plan!

There is still more you can do, the generated code could be cleaned up some as there
are some unused variables, etc.

## Importing Resources from Bridged Terraform Providers

Up until now, Terraform providers bridged this way using our parameterized
[Pulumi Terraform Provider](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform-bridge)
could not be
[imported](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/cli/commands/pulumi_import/)
correctly into other stacks (or any other parameterizable provier for that
matter).

With the release of [Pulumi 3.146.0](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/releases/tag/v3.146.0), we have also
addressed this limitation, and you can now import resources that will be
managed by the Pulumi Terraform parameterized provider and code will also be
generated to manage these resources from within Pulumi.  See the [documentation for `pulumi import`](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/cli/commands/pulumi_import/)
for more details.

## Limitations

- We still have a bit of [unimplemented Terraform functionality](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-converter-terraform/issues/65) that we're tracking and are evaluating how to move forward.  For now when these functions are detected it will require some manual intervention on the converted project before you're ready to deploy.
- If you define your terraform module in a parent directory of your deployment code, you'll encounter a [known bug](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-converter-terraform/issues/194), but a simple workaround is to restructure your Terraform code before running a conversion.
- Terraform programs are dynamically typed, when converting to a type safe language sometimes a type is unknown and still needs to be added manually (as in the typescript example above).
- Variables and configuration are not yet converted automatically, so `.tfvars` files etc will need to be manually converted into Pulumi stack configurations.
