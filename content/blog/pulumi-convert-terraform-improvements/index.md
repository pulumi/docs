Big news for infrastructure teams looking to migrate- we've just supercharged Pulumi's Terraform conversion capabilities, making it easier than ever to modernize your infrastructure as code.

Pulumi already lets you use [any Terraform/OpenTofu provider](/blog/any-terraform-provider/) in your existing projects, and now we've taken it to the next level. With [Pulumi CLI version 3.145.0](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/releases/tag/v3.145.0), you can now automatically convert **ANY** Terraform project to Pulumi - even if it uses providers that don't have native Pulumi equivalents!

<!--more-->

This means you can finally:

- Convert your entire Terraform codebase without provider limitations
- Maintain access to the Terraform providers you leverage
- Modernize your infrastructure while keeping your existing resources

## Try It Now (It's Easy!)

Ready to see it in action? Just grab the latest version of Pulumi and run:

{{% chooser language "javascript,typescript,python,go,java,yaml" %}}

{{% choosable language javascript %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language nodejs
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language typescript
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language python
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language go
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language java %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language java
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language yaml
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% /chooser %}}

This will download the necessary plugins, run the conversion and output it in
the current directory, generating all necessary project files.

You can then run `pulumi preview` to see if the project can deploy
successfully.

## See It In Action: A Real-World Example

Let's look at something cool - we'll convert a project that combines Google Cloud with PlanetScale (a provider that isn't available in the Pulumi registry yet!). This example shows how the new converter handles mixed provider scenarios effortlessly.

Here is the Terraform code in a single main.tf file:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.1.0"

  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~> 6.0"
    }
    planetscale = {
      source  = "planetscale/planetscale"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  project = var.gcp_project
  region  = var.gcp_region
  zone    = var.gcp_zone
}

provider "planetscale" {
  service_token      = var.planetscale_service_token
  service_token_name = "planetscaletoken"
}

variable "gcp_project" {
  description = "GCP project ID"
  default     = "pulumi-convert-example-gcp-project"
}

variable "gcp_region" {
  description = "GCP region to use"
  default     = "us-central1"
}

variable "gcp_zone" {
  description = "GCP zone"
  default     = "us-central1-a"
}

variable "planetscale_org" {
  description = "PlanetScale organization name"
  default     = "pulumi-convert-planetscale-org"
}

variable "planetscale_service_token" {
  description = "PlanetScale service token secret"
  sensitive   = true
  default     = "test-planetscale-service-token"
}

# Create the PlanetScale database
resource "planetscale_database" "db" {
  name         = "pulumi-convert-db"
  organization = var.planetscale_org
}

# Generate a password for connecting to the DB
resource "planetscale_password" "db_password" {
  organization = "brandonpollack23"
  name         = "terraform-generated"
  database     = planetscale_database.db.name
  branch       = planetscale_database.db.default_branch
}

# Spin up a small GCE VM
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm" {
  name         = "demo-vm"
  machine_type = "e2-micro"
  zone         = var.gcp_zone

  # Minimal Debian boot disk
  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-11"
    }
  }

  # Use the default VPC with a public IP
  network_interface {
    network = "default"
    access_config {}
  }

  # Pass PlanetScale connection info as metadata
  metadata = {
    DB_HOST = planetscale_database.db.url
    DB_USER = "root"
    DB_PASS = planetscale_password.db_password.plaintext
    DB_NAME = planetscale_database.db.name
  }
}
```
{{% notes type="warning" %}}
**Never** store secrets or keys in plain text in your code or commited
configuration files. I only have a db_password stored here in plain text for
the sake of readability.

Consider using [Pulumi ESC](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/) to store these types of
secrets (and any other configuration!) and access them directly from your Pulumi programs.
{{% /notes %}}

This alone works if you run `terraform plan`, however without *real*
credentials nothing will really deploy, of course! You can set these in `.tfvars`,
environmental variables, command line, etc.  

Even if you use a `.tfvars` file, converting this is not currently supported, so
the configuration will need to be moved to stack files in your
new Pulumi project (eg `Pulumi.dev.yaml`, `Pulumi.prod.yaml`, etc).

You can convert this into a new project with the following command:

{{% chooser language "typescript,python,go,java,yaml" %}}

{{% choosable language typescript %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language typescript --out pulumi-ts-program
```

I have opted to output it to a different directory to preserve the contents of my Terraform project.

### Project structure

If we navigate to the `pulumi-ts-program` directory, we can see a few things:

- Pulumi.yaml, the pulumi configuration file.
- index.ts, our equivalent to main.tf for typescript projects.
- sdks directory, where the generated bridged provider is output.
- other node project artifacts such as package.json, node_modules, tsconfig.json, etc..

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language python --out pulumi-python-program
```

I have opted to output it to a different directory to preserve the contents of my Terraform project.

### Project structure

If we navigate to the `pulumi-python-program` directory, we can see a few things:

- Pulumi.yaml, the pulumi configuration file.
- \_\_main\_\_.py, our equivalent to main.tf for python projects.
- sdks directory, where the generated bridged provider is output.
- other python project artifacts (eg requirments.txt, pyproject.toml, etc).

### Python specific cleanup

The python code generator may try to use subscript syntax inappropriately, so you may need to look through the generated code and switch certain things to dot access syntax like so:

```diff
metadata={
-        "DB_HOST": db["url"],
+        "DB_HOST": db.url,
        "DB_USER": "root",
-        "DB_PASS": db_password["plaintext"],
-        "DB_NAME": db["name"],
+        "DB_PASS": db_password.plaintext,
+        "DB_NAME": db.name,
}
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language go --out pulumi-go-program
```

### Project structure

If we navigate to the `pulumi-go-program` directory, we can see a few things:

- main.go, our equivalent to main.tf for golang projects
- sdks directory, where the generated bridged provider is output
- other golang project artifacts (go.mod, go.sum)

### Go specific cleanup

The go code generator outputs everything in the Terraform code, even if it is
unused. This is an error in a go program, so I had to manually remove
unreferenced variables like GCP project, region, and PlanetScale service token.

These are part of the output because in it's current iteration the code
converter will convert everything, even if ultimately it is provider
configuration (see [cleanup](#cleanup)) and not actual code.

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language java %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language go --out pulumi-go-program
```

I have opted to output it to a different directory to preserve the contents of my Terraform project.

### Project structure

If we navigate to the `pulumi-go-program` directory, we can see a few things:

- main.go, our equivalent to main.tf for golang projects
- sdks directory, where the generated bridged provider is output
- other golang project artifacts (go.mod, go.sum)

### Go specific cleanup

The java code generator does not set up the maven dependencies for you so you
need to copy the code into your source directory (as the printed instructions
say) in the output directory.

```sh
cp -r sdks/planetscale/src/* src/
```

You also might notice the generated code is using the wrong overload for
setting the metadata in your GCP instance to set environmental variables.
Quickly making sure you call "toString" on all values in the map fixes the
issue.  The code generator does it's best to make compilable code from the get
go, but sometimes there is ambiguity like these types that the user needs to go
in and fix.

```diff
.metadata(Map.ofEntries(
+    Map.entry("DB_HOST", db.url().toString()),
-    Map.entry("DB_HOST", db.url()),
    Map.entry("DB_USER", "root"),
+   Map.entry("DB_PASS", dbPassword.plaintext().toString()),
-   Map.entry("DB_PASS", dbPassword.plaintext()),
+   Map.entry("DB_NAME", db.name().toString())
-   Map.entry("DB_NAME", db.name())
))

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```shell
pulumi convert --from terraform --language yaml --out pulumi-yaml-program
```

I have opted to output it to a different directory to preserve the contents of my Terraform project.

### Project structure

If we navigate to the `pulumi-yaml-program` directory, we can see a few things:

- Pulumi.yaml, the pulumi configuration file.
- Main.yaml, our equivalent to main.tf for golang projects.
- sdks directory, where the generated bridged provider is output.

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% /chooser %}}

### Cleanup

If we simply run `pulumi preview` this project unfortunately won't run right away.  
We need to create our stack configuration that contains the GCP and PlanetScale credentials.

These were part of our `main.tf` file, but the code generator doesn't
distinguish between provider config and code, so we need to handle this
part on our own (for now).

These can go in either your `Pulumi.yaml` or your stack configuration.  Places
for them are already generated, you just need to fill them in:

```yaml
name: terraform-convert-example
runtime: nodejs
config:
  google:project:
    value: 'TODO: var.gcp_project' # fill in here
  google:region:
    value: 'TODO: var.gcp_region'
  google:zone:
    value: 'TODO: var.gcp_zone'
  planetscale:serviceToken:
    value: 'TODO: var.planetscale_service_token'
  planetscale:serviceTokenName:
    value: planetscaletoken
```

Also notice the configuration names differ from the pulumi counterparts "google" should be "gcp".

After filling things in the `Pulumi.yaml` should look something like this:

```yaml
name: terraform-convert-example
runtime: nodejs
config:
  gcp:project:
    value: 'brandonpollack23'
  gcp:region:
    value: 'us-central1'
  gcp:zone:
    value: 'us-central1-a'
  planetscale:serviceToken:
    value: 'supersecrettoken'
  planetscale:serviceTokenName:
    value: planetscaletoken
```

and if you run `pulumi preview` it successfully generates a plan!

There is still more you can do, the generated code could be cleaned up some as there
are some unused variables, etc.

## Importing Resources from Bridged Terraform Providers

Up until now, Terraform providers bridged this way using our parameterized
[Pulumi Terraform Provider](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform-bridge)
could not be
[imported](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/cli/commands/pulumi_import/)
correctly into other stacks (or any other parameterizable provider for that
matter).

With the release of [Pulumi 3.146.0](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/releases/tag/v3.146.0), we have also
addressed this limitation, and you can now import resources that will be
managed by the Pulumi Terraform parameterized provider and code will also be
generated to manage these resources from within Pulumi.  See the [documentation for `pulumi import`](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/cli/commands/pulumi_import/)
for more details.

## Considerations

- We still have a bit of [unimplemented Terraform functionality](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-converter-terraform/issues/65) that we're tracking.  For now when these functions are detected, but require some manual intervention on the converted project.
- If you define your Terraform Module in a parent directory of your deployment code, you'll encounter a [known bug](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-converter-terraform/issues/194), but a simple workaround is to restructure your Terraform code before running a conversion.
- Terraform programs are dynamically typed, when converting to a type safe language sometimes a type is unknown and still needs to be added manually (as in the typescript example above).
- Variables and configuration are not yet converted automatically, so `.tfvars` files etc will need to be manually converted into Pulumi stack configurations.

## What's Really New Here? 🚀

1. **Automatic Provider Bridging**: The converter now automatically handles any Terraform provider, even ones without Pulumi equivalents
2. **Improved Import Support**: With [Pulumi 3.146.0](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/releases/tag/v3.146.0), you can now import resources from any bridged provider
3. **Seamless Integration**: Generated code works right out of the box with minimal tweaking needed

## The Road Ahead

Stay tuned for even more improvements to make your infrastructure modernization journey smoother!
