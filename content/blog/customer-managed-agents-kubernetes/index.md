We are excited to announce the availability of Kubernetes-native support for Pulumi Deployments Customer-Managed Agents, further enhancing the flexibility and control over your infrastructure deployments. This new feature allows you to self-host deployment agents within your Kubernetes environment, bringing the same power and flexibility of Pulumi-hosted deployments to isolated environments.

## Customer Managed Agents: Flexibility and Control

Customer Managed Agents, [announced earlier this year](/blog/customer-managed-deployment-agents-launch), allow you to self-host deployment agents, delivering the power and flexibility of Pulumi Deployments within your own infrastructure. Here’s how you can benefit:

- **Host Anywhere**: Deploy Customer Managed Agents on any hardware or environment of your choice, including fully private VPCs.
- **Compliance and Security**: Keep your cloud provider credentials within your private network, meeting stringent compliance requirements.
- **Scalability**: Set up multiple agent pools and scale dynamically, supporting up to 150 concurrent deployments.
- **Versatility**: Mix and match Pulumi-hosted and self-hosted deployments to suit different infrastructure needs.

### Key Features of Pulumi Deployments

Customer-Managed agents support all the capabilities of [Pulumi Deployments](/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments/) including:

1. **Multiple Deployment Triggers**: Supports all Pulumi Deployment triggers such as Drift Detection, Scheduled Deployments, click to deploy, REST API, Git push to deploy, Review Stacks, and remote Automation API.
2. **OpenID Authentication**: Fetch tokens dynamically for increased security.
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Configure through YAML files or environment variables, adaptable to various deployment environments.

## Docker and Kubernetes Support

By default, Customer-Managed Agents are deployed on Virtual Machines using Docker. However, with this new release, you can now leverage Kubernetes to run these agents, enabling you to deploy them within your existing infrastructure.  This integrates natively with Kubernetes pods and does not require Docker in Docker or privileged execution.

### Getting Started with Kubernetes

To use Kubernetes for running Customer-Managed Agents:

1. **Install the Pulumi GitHub App**: [Install the Pulumi GitHub App](/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/continuous-delivery/github-app) and ensure that it is integrated with your source control.
2. **Set Up Deployment Pools**:
   - Navigate to Deployment Runners under Organization Settings in the left hand navigation bar.
   - Create a new pool by clicking 'Add new pool'
   - You will get a new access token, copy and save the token.
3. **Install Agents**:
   - Follow the instructions provided on the Deployment Runners page to install agents within your Kubernetes environment.
4. **Configure Agents**:
   - All configuration for Customer-Managed Agents is done through the `pulumi-deployment-agent.yaml`file. This file can be created manually or with the `customer-managed-deployment-agent configure` command.
   - Or you can leverage the [Pulumi program example repo](https://github.com/pulumi/customer-managed-deployment-agent/tree/main/kubernetes).
   - Set environment variables directly in your Kubernetes deployment.
1. **Configure Stack**:
   - Go to Deploy settings, found under the Settings tab on a stack. Scroll down and select the pool you created under the Deployment Runner pool drop-down.

### Verification

After setting up, verify the agent by doing a `pulumi refresh` through the Deploy Actions drop-down on your stack page.

To increase deployment concurrency, use the same token to set up multiple agents and they will be assigned to the same pool.

## Wrapping It Up

Customer-Managed Agents with Kubernetes support empower you to manage deployments according to your specific needs. Whether it’s for security, compliance, or operational efficiency, this feature provides the flexibility and control necessary for modern infrastructure management.
