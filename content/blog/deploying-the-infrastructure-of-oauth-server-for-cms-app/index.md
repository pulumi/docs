In our [previous post]({{< relref "/blog/deploying-netlify-cms-on-aws" >}}), we deployed our CMS app on AWS instead of Netlify. We couldn't use [Netlify's Identity Service](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/#enable-identity-in-the-ui), which manages Github access to Netlify CMS, because we deployed on AWS. As a result, we need to implement an [External OAuth Server](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/#header).

We used Netlify's Go example to deploy on ECS Fargate and configure the domain and certificate. We'll show how we accomplished the deployment.

<!--more-->

Backend is a package that supports communications between Netlify CMS and repositories like Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket. The Pulumi [example code](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/aws-ts-netlify-cms-and-oauth/cms-oauth)uses [backend](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/github-backend/) to authenticate to the CMS.

OAuth Server also enables authorization for Gitlab and Bitbucket by changing the callback URL to `https://{{YOUR_OAUTH_SERVER_URL}}/callback/{{YOUR_BACKEND_NAME}}`. To learn more about configuring OAuth Server, refer to the "Environment Variable and Pulumi Stack Configuration" section.

## Make Changes to Example Code

Netlify CMS's website provides [External OAuth Client examples](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/#header) for various languages and platforms. We use the [Go example]((https://github.com/igk1972/netlify-cms-oauth-provider-go))  to demonstrate the client.

In *Netlify's example*, the `./dotenv/dotenv.go` retrieves environment variables from a file. The main.go file uses [goth](https://github.com/markbates/goth) to instantiate the OAuth Provider. The code `./randstr/randstr.go` file to generate a random string used by `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable used for authentication. However,  Pulumi can implement both functions, replacing the code in goth.

The random string can be generated with Pulumi this way:

```typescript
// Create a random string and also mark its `result` property as a secret,
// so it is not stored in plaintext in the stack's state.
const sessionSecretRandomString = new random.RandomPassword("random", {
    length: 32,
}, { additionalSecretOutputs: ["result"] });
```

Environment variables can be passed when we create a Fargate Service.

```typescript
// Create a Fargate service task that can scale out.
const appService = new awsx.ecs.FargateService("app-svc", {
    cluster,
    taskDefinitionArgs: {
        container: {
            image: img,
            memory: 128 /*MB*/,
            portMappings: [ tg ],
            environment: [
                {
                    name: "HOST",
                    // The target domain which would concatenate with callbacks in main.go
                    value: pulumi.interpolate `https://${cmsStackConfig.targetDomain}`
                },
                {
                    name: "SESSION_SECRET",
                    value: sessionSecretRandomString.result
                },
                {
                    name: "GITHUB_KEY",
                    value: cmsStackConfig.githubKey
                },
                {
                    name: "GITHUB_SECRET",
                    value: cmsStackConfig.githubSecret
                },
                {
                    name: "TARGET_PORT",
                    value: pulumi.interpolate `${inputTargetGroupPort}`
                },
                {
                    name: "GITHUB_SCOPE",
                    value: inputGithubScope
                },
            ]
        },
    },
    desiredCount: 1,
});
```

We can safely remove the `randstr` and `dotenv` folders in the OAuth client.

### Setting Github Scope

When building an OAuth application for Github, it's important to note that that the default  [github scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/) of *Netlify CMS's example code* is read-only. When we call the `github.New` function, read and write access must be set to edit a target repository.

We can set the GitHub scope as an environmental variable, e.g., `GITHUB_SCOPE` set to `public_repo`, which grants read and write access to public repository. We can even add several scope values by adding `,` between scope values. The `GITHUB_SCOPE` value is read and parsed when the Fargate Service is created, which sets the scope for the `Github.New` function.

```go
githubScope := os.Getenv("GITHUB_SCOPE")
    if githubScope == "" {
        goth.UseProviders(
            github.New(
                os.Getenv("GITHUB_KEY"), os.Getenv("GITHUB_SECRET"),
                // concatenate with the host name
                fmt.Sprintf("%s/callback/github", host),
                "public_repo",
            ),
            bitbucket.New(
                os.Getenv("BITBUCKET_KEY"), os.Getenv("BITBUCKET_SECRET"),
                fmt.Sprintf("%s/callback//bitbucket", host),
            ),
            gitlabProvider,
        )
    } else {
        scopeArray := strings.Split(githubScope, ",")
        goth.UseProviders(
            github.New(
                os.Getenv("GITHUB_KEY"), os.Getenv("GITHUB_SECRET"),
                // concatenate with the host name
                fmt.Sprintf("%s/callback/github", host),
                scopeArray...,
            ),
            bitbucket.New(
                os.Getenv("BITBUCKET_KEY"), os.Getenv("BITBUCKET_SECRET"),
                fmt.Sprintf("%s/callback//bitbucket", host),
            ),
            gitlabProvider,
        )
    }
```

## Creating the Application Image

Replace the working directory in the Dockerfile with the path to your cloned repository.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/pulumi/aws-ts-netlify-cms-and-oauth/cms-oauth
```

Setting the working directory will copy your content to the Docker Image which we will deploy to AWS Fargate.

Now that CMS Server is deployed, we can start to implement the infrastructure.

## Infrastructure

### Deploying use ECS Fargate

To deploy the OAuth server to AWS Fargate, we'll use the [Hello Fargate Example](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/aws-ts-hello-fargate) from the [Pulumi's example repository](https://github.com/pulumi/examples) as a template.

The example creates an ECS cluster, an Application Load Balancer (alb) with a listener, and a Fargate Service. We'll change the script to deploy our Docker image.

First, we specify the port number of the alb to 443, the standard port for HTTPS, instead of port 80 because the URL in main.go starts with `https://`. HTTPS is also more secure when handling the CMS access token.

```typescript
// Define an ec2 application load balancer alb to distribute incomming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones.
const alb = new awsx.elasticloadbalancingv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer(
    "net-lb", { external: true, securityGroups: cluster.securityGroups });

// alb need a listener to listen to 443 the standard port for the HTTPS traffic, certificate is using the certificate we created above
const web = alb.createListener("web", {
    port: 443,
    external: true,
    protocol: "HTTPS",
    certificateArn: certificate.arn
});
```

We also created a single target group for load balancers to distribute the traffic. This lets the user address a different port for the target group without having to use port 443.

``` typescript
let inputTargetGroupPort: pulumi.Input<number> = cmsStackConfig.targetGroupPort!;

if (inputTargetGroupPort === undefined) {
    inputTargetGroupPort = 80;
}

// when Listener Rule is satisfied then traffic is route to this target group.
const tg = alb.createTargetGroup("oauth-tg", {
    port: inputTargetGroupPort,
    loadBalancer: alb
});
```

The target group port can be optionally configured to use a different target group port.

We can set the ports with `pulumi config set cms-OAuth:targetGroupPort`. The default port is 80, which is the http port for local development.

The load balancer implements a listener and a rule to forward all requests to the target group we created.

```typescript
// when the request are forwarded then every requests are send to the target group we created
new awsx.lb.ListenerRule("oauth-listener-rule", web, {
    actions: [{
        type: "forward",
        targetGroupArn: tg.targetGroup.arn,
    }],
    conditions: [{
        field: "path-pattern",
        values: "/*", //wildcard says every request would be send
    }],
});
```

#### Environment Variables and Pulumi Stack Configuration

The Fargate service requires several environment variables to start. Here are the variables we need to configure:

- HOST is the URL for the OAuth Server, and we set it by running `pulumi config set pulumi-website-cms:targetDomain <OAuth server URL>`
- SESSION_SECRET is generated by using Pulumiâ€™s random package. 
- GITHUB_SECRET and GITHUB_TOKEN are provided by Github when the Github OAuth application is registered. Netlify provides instructions for obtaining these credentials.
- The `targetDomain` is the URL of our CMS. 
- GITHUB_SCOPE sets the type of access the CMS has for the target repository.

We can set the github key and secret in the stack configuration. The --secret flag encrypts your GitHub secret. It is good practice to use the --secret flag, e.g., $ pulumi config set --secret netlify-cms-oauth-provider-infrastructure:githubKey {{YOUR_GITHUB_SECRET}}, because appending the secret in the command line stores it in the command history. The --secret flag lets you enter the secret at the prompt, which hides the value.

```bash
$ pulumi config set netlify-cms-oauth-provider-infrastructure:githubKey {{YOUR_GITHUB_KEY}}
$ pulumi config set --secret netlify-cms-oauth-provider-infrastructure:githubSecret
$ {{YOUR_GITHUB_SECRET}}

```typescript
// Create a Fargate service task that can scale out.
const appService = new awsx.ecs.FargateService("app-svc", {
    cluster,
    taskDefinitionArgs: {
        container: {
            image: img,
            memory: 128 /*MB*/,
            portMappings: [ tg ],
            environment: [
                {
                    name: "HOST",
                    // The target domain which would concatenate with callbacks in main.go
                    value: pulumi.interpolate `https://${cmsStackConfig.targetDomain}`
                },
                {
                    name: "SESSION_SECRET",
                    value: sessionSecretRandomString.result
                },
                {
                    name: "GITHUB_KEY",
                    value: cmsStackConfig.githubKey
                },
                {
                    name: "GITHUB_SECRET",
                    value: cmsStackConfig.githubSecret
                },
                {
                    name: "TARGET_PORT",
                    value: pulumi.interpolate `${inputTargetGroupPort}`
                },
                {
                    name: "GITHUB_SCOPE",
                    value: inputGithubScope
                },
            ]
        },
    },
    desiredCount: 1,
});
```





The environment variables are passed to the OAuth server in main.go. For example, the callback URL  is the targetDomain with `callback` and the repository provider appended, e.g., `https://<targetDomain>/callback/github/`. You can also specify a different repository provider, such as Bitbucket or Gitlab.

```go
    github.New(
        os.Getenv("GITHUB_KEY"), os.Getenv("GITHUB_SECRET"),
        // concatenate with the host name
        fmt.Sprintf("%s/callback/github", host),
        "public_repo",
    )
```


We can set the github key and secret in the stack configuration.

```bash
$ pulumi config set netlify-cms-oauth-provider-infrastructure:githubKey {{YOUR_GITHUB_KEY}}
$ pulumi config set --secret netlify-cms-oauth-provider-infrastructure:githubSecret
$ {{YOUR_GITHUB_SECRET}}
```

The `--secret` flag encrypts your GitHub secret.

In addition, don't append the secret to the command, e.g., `$ pulumi config set --secret netlify-cms-oauth-provider-infrastructure:githubKey {{YOUR_GITHUB_SECRET}}`.

Your secret would be stored in the command history. Instead, specify the key without a value and enter the secret at the prompt which hides the value.

We pass `TARGET_PORT` to `targetGroupPort` which is the port used to serve the application. We should also check if this variable is set in main.go in case we need to test locally without Pulumi.

```go
targetGroupPort := os.Getenv("TARGET_PORT")
    if targetGroupPort == "" {
        targetGroupPort = "80"
    }
    listenPort := ":" + targetGroupPort
    fmt.Print("Started running on", listenPort, "\n")
    // listen on port 80 where we created the target group
    fmt.Println(http.ListenAndServe(listenPort, nil))
```

As mentioned previously, `GITHUB_SCOPE` sets the type of access the CMS has for the target repository. It is also an optional stack configuration where the default in [our Pulumi example](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/aws-ts-netlify-cms-and-oauth/cms-oauth) is set as `public_repo`.

### Create a Certificate for the OAuth Server

The process is similar to how we created a certificate for CMS in our [previous post]({{< relref "/blog/deploying-netlify-cms-on-aws" >}}). We use what we need just for creating the certificate.

When we create the Alias Record, we configure it with application load balancer settings.

```typescript
// Creates a new Route53 DNS record pointing the domain to the CloudFront distribution.
function createAliasRecord(
    targetDomain: string, lb: awsx.elasticloadbalancingv2.ApplicationLoadBalancer): aws.route53.Record {
    const domainParts = getDomainAndSubdomain(targetDomain);
    const hostedZoneId = aws.route53.getZone({ name: domainParts.parentDomain }, { async: true }).then(zone => zone.zoneId);
    return new aws.route53.Record(
        targetDomain,
        {
            name: domainParts.subdomain,
            zoneId: hostedZoneId,
            type: "A",
            aliases: [
                {
                    name: lb.loadBalancer.dnsName,
                    zoneId: lb.loadBalancer.zoneId,
                    evaluateTargetHealth: true,
                },
            ],
        });
}
// Create the aliasRecord with targetdomain and application load balancer
const aRecord = createAliasRecord(cmsStackConfig.targetDomain, alb);
```

We run `pulumi up` to deploy.

### Github Workflow (Optional)

We can automate our build with the Github workflow in the folder `cms-oauth/.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`. The workflow uses the repository secret we set in Github.

![Github Secret](./github_secret.jpg)

## Last Step

Finally, we need to update the CMS configuration file.

To combine our deployment of CMS and CMS OAuth Server, we specify the site_domain and URL in `./public/config.yml` of the CMS folder.

```yaml
backend:
  name: github
  # Replace this with the Github repo you want to make change
  repo: github-username/target-github-repo
  # This site_domain and base_url are placeholders, replace with the correct one.
  site_domain: https://some-cms-domain.com # CMS's domain
  base_url: https://some-oauth-domain.com # OAuth Server's domain
```

The site_domain is the URL of the CMS and the base_url is the URL of the OAuth Server . They should be the same as the `targetDomain` variable we set in the stack configuration of both CMS and OAuth Server.

## In the End

Congratulations on building both CMS web application, the OAuth client-server, and also deploying the infrastructure! Now if everything works perfectly, you should see the **Login with Github** button and clicking it would redirect to the GitHub login page.

People with correct access can now use the CMS.
