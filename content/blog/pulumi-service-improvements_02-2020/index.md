We've been hard at work making it easier to manage stacks, permissions, and organizations in the Pulumi Console. Adding
new features like first-class support for stack tags, deep links into CI/CD providers, and downloadable checkpoint files.

In this post, we showcase what's new!

## First-class Support for Tags

Pulumi has had support for [stack tags]({{< relref "/docs/intro/concepts/stack#stack-tags" >}}) for a while, enabling
you to add attributes to your stacks with custom data such as the `account-id` or `environment`. But previously the data was
only available on the command-line, via the `pulumi stack tag` command ([documentation]({{< relref "/docs/reference/cli/pulumi_stack_tag" >}})).

We've added first-class support for stack tags in the Pulumi Console as well. You can create, update, and delete tags from within the console.

Making it easier to create and edit tag data is just the beginning. We've started to add new search/filtering capabilities
based on stack tags. For example, you can now use filters to rapidly add stacks to [Pulumi teams]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/collaboration/teams" >}}).

{{< figure alt="Filtering stacks by their tags" src="./filter-stacks-by-tag.png" class="md:max-w-lg" >}}

We will continue wiring stack tags throughout other parts of the Pulumi Console, so stay tuned! Also, this new feature was
added by Pulumi's first (and extremely awesome) intern, Tasia (ðŸ‘‹)!

## Deep Linking into CI/CD Systems

Many people practice [continuous delivery using Pulumi]({{< relref "/docs/guides/continuous-delivery" >}}), automatically
updating stacks in response to code check-ins or merges. We've now added support for deep links from the Pulumi Console back
into your CI/CD tool of choice. So, for example, you'll now see links to the [Circle CI job](http://circleci.com) or
[Travis CI build](https://travis-ci.com) from the Pulumi Console.

> Pulumi supports a variety of CI/CD providers, but if yours isn't listed in [our CI/CD guide]({{< relref "/docs/guides/continuous-delivery" >}})
> [let us know](https://slack.pulumi.com) or [contribute it](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/sdk/go/common/util/ciutil)
> on your own.

## Pretty Printing JSON / Multi Configuration

We now pretty print JSON configuration values and have much better support for viewing multi-line data.

## Download Earlier Checkpoints

The most important job of the Pulumi Console is to maintain a durable, accurate snapshot of your cloud resource data.
While in most cases your [stack's checkpoint data]({{< relref "/docs/intro/concepts/state" >}}) is a low-level detail
you don't need to worry about; in some advanced scenarios, you may need to inspect or edit it manually.

You can now download a stackâ€™s checkpoint file directly from the Pulumi Console. You can get the
same data from the command-line, using `pulumi stack export` ([documentation]({{< relref "/docs/reference/cli/pulumi_stack_export" >}})),
which now supports a `--version` flag to export older checkpoint files too.

## Reverse Stack Permissions View

The Team Pro and Enterprise editions support [role-based access control]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/collaboration/stack-permissions" >}})
using [teams]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/collaboration/teams" >}}). But a common problem we've heard from people in large organizations
is that it can be difficult to review exactly *_what_* access someone has to a stack and *_why_*.

Fortunately, the Pulumi Console now has the ability for organization administrators to see all stacks a particular member has access to.

{{< figure alt="Stacks an organization member has access to" src="./list-of-accessible-stacks.png" class="md:max-w-lg" >}}

They can even go one step further, review the specific access granted from various sources.

## Log Rendering Performance

We've made some changes that dramatically improve the Pulumi Console's performance when rendering large update logs.

{{< figure alt="Log rendering performance" src="./log-rendering-perf.gif" class="md:max-w-lg" >}}

## Audit Logs

Pulumi Enterprise customers typically have many stacks and teams. Multiple teams and stacks can make it difficult to review what's currently in-motion and to understand a sequence of events a few days or few weeks in the past.

[As we announced earlier]({{< relref "/blog/auditing-your-organizations-infrastructure-as-code-activity" >}}) we launched the ability to view
and download audit logs with all the changes within an organization.

## Conclusion

Phew! As I said, we've been busy this month working on the Pulumi Console. And there is plenty more awesomeness still in the pipe!

As always, we love to hear if you have any feedback, suggestions, or ideas for other improvements we could make to the
Pulumi Console. Just let us know on the [Pulumi Community Slack](https://slack.pulumi.com), Twitter [@PulumiCorp](https://twitter.com/pulumicorp),
