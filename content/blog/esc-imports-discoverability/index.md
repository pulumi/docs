Managing secrets and configuration across multiple environments and stacks can easily become complex, leading to duplicated values, inconsistencies, and security risks. [Pulumi ESC](/product/esc) solves this with composable environments via [imports](/docs/esc/environments/imports/), allowing you to define configuration once and reuse it organization-wide.  Now, with the new capabilities to discover environment imports, you gain unprecedented visibility and control, simplifying the management of even the most complex infrastructure and applications.

## Understanding Pulumi ESC Imports

Pulumi ESC lets you define secrets and configuration as code collections called [environments](/docs/esc/environments/working-with-environments/). These environments can import other environments, creating a hierarchical structure that promotes reusability, and reduces duplication and sprawl. You can centralize secrets and configuration within ESC and use them across [Pulumi IaC Stacks](/docs/esc/integrations/infrastructure/pulumi-iac/), [Pulumi Insights Accounts](/docs/pulumi-cloud/insights/accounts/), and various other platforms through our [integrations](/docs/esc/integrations/).

By using [version tags](/docs/esc/environments/versioning/#tagging-versions), imports can target specific versions of an environment. This locks down the configuration used by dependents, ensuring stability and preventing unintended changes from rolling out to your critical environments. 

## What's New?

We've added powerful discoverability features to give you clear insight into your environment dependencies:

- **New "Imported By" tab**: Easily understand downstream dependencies by clicking the "Imported By" tab for each environment. This tab shows all environments and stacks that import a specific environment, including the specific tagged version used. Filter and sort by imported versions and downstream resources to narrow in on the resources that will be affected by a change you are trying to make. 
- **Warnings for deletions and tag movements**: Pulumi ESC now warns you about the potential impact of deleting an environment or modifying version tags before you make the change, helping you avoid disruptions.
- **Enhanced environment page**: The Environments page now clearly indicates if an environment is used by other environments, stacks, or insights accounts, providing valuable relationship context at a glance.
- **Pulumi IaC stack visibility**: Environment import information is also available on the Stacks page and within individual stack overview pages.

## Conclusion 

Pulumi ESC's import feature is a paradigm shift in how you manage your secrets and configuration. The new suite of import discoverability features gives you the confidence to manage complex deployments with ease.
