Pulumi is hosting a webinar with AWS Fargate **on
February 5th, 10AM PST** (register
[here](https://www.pulumi.com/resources/#upcoming)).
We'll be chatting about how to implement cloud native infrastructure
across your organization using [AWS and Pulumi](/crosswalk/aws/): general purpose programming
languages to deliver everything from VMs to Kubernetes to Serverless.

[Registration link](https://www.pulumi.com/resources/#upcoming).
Specifically, you will learn:

- How using general-purpose programming languages provides familiar
  and powerful programming concepts to infrastructure-as-code
  challenges
- How Pulumi can help build a library of code packages to enhance
  efficiency when implementing standard policies, network best
  practices, and more
- Best practices for becoming a deployment-focused organization,
  rather than configuration-focused, to continuously deliver new
  cloud-native infrastructure with containerization

Joining us is Pulumi customer [Learning
Machine](https://www.hyland.com/). Adopting Pulumi helped
Learning Machine reduce 25,000 LoC of ad-hoc DevOps scripts to 500 LoC
of JavaScript, improving time to ship code, time to provision and
onboard new customers, and unify their Development and DevOps teams and
techniques.
