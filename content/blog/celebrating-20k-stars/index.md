Today, we're excited to announce that the [Pulumi open source project](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi) has crossed the incredible milestone of 20,000 stars on GitHub. 🎉 This is a huge achievement, and it wouldn't have been possible without y'all - our incredible global community of developers.

Since its inception, Pulumi's vision has been rooted in enabling teams to build and manage modern cloud infrastructure using familiar languages and tools. Over the years, your feedback, contributions, and passion have been invaluable in shaping Pulumi into what it is today. Seeing so many developers embrace our modern approach to cloud infrastructure management is really exciting. We are deeply grateful for the trust y'all have placed in us, and we will continue to push the boundaries in how teams manage cloud infrastructure.

## Fueled by Community Contributions
Over the past 7 years, the Pulumi project has had 4,400+ contributors that made 75,000+ pull requests. Pulumi is depended upon by 6,600+ GitHub projects and supports over 160+ packages in the registry. It has been downloaded more than 100 million times by 170,000+ developers. In just the last month, Pulumi has been the most active Infrastructure as Code (IaC) open-source project compared to Terraform or OpenTofu. Pulumi has had 117 merged pull requests (67 TF, 83 OpenTofu), 82 closed issues (49 TF, 54 OpenTofu), and 53 new issues (27 TF, 29, OpenTofu).
