One year ago today -- on June 18, 2018 --
[we open sourced Pulumi]({{< relref "introducing-pulumi-a-cloud-development-platform" >}}),
a new approach to multi-cloud infrastructure as code using your favorite
languages. And what a year it has been!
<!--more-->

Here are some highlights we've added in partnership with the community
since launching:

-   Over 100 [examples](https://github.com/pulumi/examples),
    [tutorials]({{< ref "/docs/tutorials" >}}), and a brand new
    [Getting Started guide]({{< ref "/docs/get-started" >}}).
-   [A native Kubernetes provider with 100% Kubernetes API/version coverage.]({{< relref "pulumi-a-better-way-to-kubernetes" >}})
-   A steady stream of improvements across
    [AWS]({{< ref "/docs/get-started/aws" >}}),
    [Azure]({{< ref "/docs/get-started/azure" >}}), and
    [Google Cloud]({{< ref "/docs/get-started/gcp" >}}) providers.
-   [Pulumi Crosswalk for AWS, a framework with built-in AWS infrastructure best practices.]({{< relref "/crosswalk/aws" >}})
-   Over 20 additional providers, including
    [CloudFlare](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-cloudflare),
    [Digital Ocean](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-digitalocean), and
    [MySQL]({{< relref "managing-your-mysql-databases-with-pulumi" >}}).
-   Brought our [Python 3 SDK]({{< ref "/docs/reference/pkg/python" >}})
    to parity with our
    [Node.js-based JavaScript and TypeScript SDKs]({{< ref "/docs/reference/pkg/nodejs" >}}).
-   [Team and Enterprise SaaS editions for teams managing infrastructure in production.](https://www.pulumi.com/pricing)
-   [GitHub, GitLab, Atlassian, and SAML/SSO identity providers.]({{< ref "/docs/intro/console/accounts-and-organizations/organizations" >}})
-   [CI/CD integrations with GitHub, GitLab, Codefresh, CircleCI, major clouds, and more.]({{< ref "/docs/guides/continuous-delivery" >}})
-   [Pluggable secrets management and transitive state encryption.]({{< relref "managing-secrets-with-pulumi" >}})
-   [Pluggable state backends for AWS S3, Azure Blob Store, and Google Cloud Store.]({{< ref "/docs/intro/concepts/state" >}})
-   [Tools for managing complex, multi-stack environments, including Terraform integration.]({{< relref "using-terraform-remote-state-with-pulumi" >}})
-   Numerous engine reliability and performance improvements, including parallelism.
-   [75 blogs, increasingly focused on end to end solutions we see working with customers.]({{< ref "/blog" >}})

In addition to the steady stream of product improvements, the community
has grown fast:

-   **1,000s of cloud engineers** trying out Pulumi across over **1,000
    companies**.
-   **1,000 end users** collaborating in our Community Slack --
    including emerging MVPs!
-   Open source contributions from **over 100 community members**.
-   Nearly **5,000 commits**, across **over 100 open source Git
    repositories**.

What we've enjoyed most is hearing about the innovation you, the end
user and customer, have accomplished thanks to Pulumi's unique approach.
These experiences range from enabling better collaboration between
application and infrastructure engineers; vastly improved productivity;
more secure, robust, and reliable delivery pipelines; and an improved
ability to go to production in multiple clouds, including by leveraging
the cloud native Kubernetes stack.

A few notable success stories include:

-   **Mercedes-Benz R&D North America** used Python infrastructure as
    code to break down team silos between developers and infrastructure
    engineers.
-   **Tableau** was able to get up and running with Kubernetes in AWS,
    using Amazon EKS, and make progress on their journey to bringing
    continuous delivery to their organization.
-   **Learning Machine** went from 25KLOC YAML to 500 lines of
    JavaScript, got containers running in AWS and Kubernetes, and halved
    their cloud bill along the way.

-   **Mapbox** built a scalable IoT tracking solution with serverless
    Lambdas. [Read more.]({{< relref "mapbox-iot-as-code-with-pulumi-crosswalk-for-aws" >}})
-   Multiple early stage startups, including **Jargon**, a TechStars
    company, have used Pulumi to get up and running quickly in the cloud
    -- doing in days what used to take weeks.
-   **Dozens** of more great stories that we can't wait to share in the
    weeks to come!

We want to sincerely thank our community and our customers and partners
-- without you, the year wouldn't have nearly been as successful. The
best part is that we're only just getting started. Expect another year
of more innovation, growing community engagement, customer success, and
more focus on end to end solutions borne out of experience.

Whether it's adopting infrastructure as code on your favorite cloud,
deploying containers to Kubernetes, or architecting and executing on
your multi-cloud journey, Pulumi is here for you!

Sincerely,

Joe and the Pulumi Team
