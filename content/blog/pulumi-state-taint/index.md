        ðŸŽ¯ Precise resource control is here!
        
        Pulumi CLI v3.192.0 adds `pulumi state taint` and `pulumi state untaint` commands.
        
        Mark resources for replacement without changing your code. Perfect for corrupted VMs, expired certs, or stuck Kubernetes objects.

        ðŸš€ New in Pulumi CLI v3.192.0: Surgical Infrastructure Replacement
        
        Sometimes the fastest path to healthy infrastructure is a targeted replacement. A VM with a corrupted disk, a certificate that needs regeneration, or a Kubernetes object stuck in a bad state.
        
        Now you can handle these scenarios without refactoring code or editing state files:
        
        âœ… `pulumi state taint <resource-urn>` - Mark for replacement
        âœ… `pulumi state untaint <resource-urn>` - Cancel the replacement  
        âœ… Normal `pulumi preview` and `pulumi up` workflow
        
        Clean, surgical, predictable. The way infrastructure management should be.

Sometimes infrastructure needs a clean slate. A VM with a corrupted disk, an expired certificate, or a stuck Kubernetes object. [Pulumi CLI v3.192.0](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/releases/tag/v3.192.0) introduces `pulumi state taint` and `pulumi state untaint` commands that let you mark resources for replacementâ€”especially valuable when you have state access but restricted cloud permissions.

<!--more-->

## The New Commands

- **`pulumi state taint <resource-urn>`** - Mark a resource for replacement
- **`pulumi state untaint <resource-urn>`** - Cancel the replacement (use `--all` to untaint all resources)

> **Note**: This provides the same functionality as `pulumi up --replace <urn>`, but lets you mark resources upfront and preview changes before the update. This can be preferred when the `pulumi up` happens later in CI/CD, where arranging for `--replace` flags would be tedious.

## Why This Matters

The taint and untaint commands solve several infrastructure management challenges. For example, many organizations restrict direct cloud access to production environments, allowing changes only through CI/CD pipelines. In these cases, you can access Pulumi state but not cloud APIs directlyâ€”taint lets you mark problematic resources for replacement and let the next automated deployment handle the actual changes, no emergency access requests required.

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Find the resource URN
pulumi stack --show-urns

# 2. Mark for replacement
pulumi state taint urn:pulumi:production::webapp::aws:ec2/instance:Instance::web-server

# 3. Preview the changes
pulumi preview

# 4. Apply the replacement
pulumi up

# Optional: Cancel the taint
pulumi state untaint urn:pulumi:production::webapp::aws:ec2/instance:Instance::web-server
```

## Get Started

Available now in [Pulumi CLI v3.192.0](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/releases/tag/v3.192.0). Try it in a development stack first to get familiar with the workflow.
