Developers are losing days every month to infrastructure bottlenecks, compliance hurdles, and inconsistent environments.
Platform engineering promised to fix that, yet [too many platforms fail](/blog/the-guide-platform-engineering-idp-steps-best-practices) before they deliver real impact.

<!--more-->

The problem isn't whether you choose Backstage or Pulumi IDP.
The real question is: **Will your platform treat infrastructure as a first-class concern, or as an afterthought?**

According to Gartner, **80% of large enterprises will deploy [internal developer platforms](/docs/pulumi-cloud/developer-platforms) within the next two years**.
But without a strong [infrastructure foundation](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code), those platforms risk becoming expensive, hard-to-maintain bottlenecks instead of accelerators.

## Why Many Platform Engineering Efforts Fail

Platform teams consistently make four critical mistakes:

1. **Neglecting Infrastructure Foundations**  
   Over-focusing on the developer portal experience while letting infrastructure governance and scalability lag behind.

2. **Ignoring Cost Efficiency**  
   Prioritizing productivity at the expense of [cloud cost management](/blog/finops-with-pulumi).  
   Example: One company considered giving every developer their own cluster, a scaling nightmare both technically and financially.

3. **Treating Security & Governance as Add-Ons**  
   Bolting on compliance after launch leads to constant firefighting and [security debt](/blog/devsecops-strategy-security-automation-tivity-health).

4. **Building for Yesterday's Architecture**  
   Designing general-purpose platforms that can't keep up with [Kubernetes-native workloads](/docs/iac/clouds/kubernetes).

## Portal-First vs Infrastructure-First

There are two dominant approaches:

- **Portal-First** typified by Backstage, which starts with developer experience and service catalogs.
- **Infrastructure-First** exemplified by Pulumi IDP, which builds the platform foundation around scalable, policy-driven infrastructure.

| Feature / Concern | Backstage (Portal-First) | Pulumi IDP (Infrastructure-First) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Developer portal & catalog | Scalable, policy-driven infrastructure |
| **Setup Time** | 12-18 months | Weeks |
| **Maintenance** | 3-5 FTE ongoing | Minimal ongoing overhead |
| **Infra Provisioning** | Requires separate tooling | Built-in |
| **Cost Awareness** | Depends on infra layer | Native |
| **Security & Governance** | Add-on | Built-in from day one |

## Backstage: The Portal-First Approach

Backstage is an open-source framework for building developer portals.
Originally built by Spotify, it excels at unifying tools, services, and documentation.

### Strengths

- **Mature Ecosystem** with over 1,200 integrations and a large community.
- **Excellent Service Catalog** providing centralized metadata, ownership, and discovery.
- **Docs-as-Code** that keeps documentation close to the codebase.
- **Self-Service Templates** that standardize [scaffolding for new projects](/templates).

### Challenges

- **High Maintenance Overhead** requiring 3-5 FTEs just to keep it running in large orgs.
- **Complex Setup** with Yarn version headaches, TypeScript complexity, plugin upkeep.
- **Infra as an Afterthought** that lacks built-in provisioning, often pushing infra concerns down the road.
- **Hidden Costs** resulting in multi-million dollar TCO over three years for a 300-dev team when factoring in staffing and infra complexity.

## Pulumi IDP: The Infrastructure-First Approach

Pulumi IDP brings **[Infrastructure Platform Engineering](/what-is/what-is-platform-engineering) (IPE)** to the forefront by embedding scalable, secure, cost-aware infrastructure into the platform from day one.

### Strengths

- **Infrastructure as a First-Class Concern** with built-in multitenancy, isolation, and [governance](/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/crossguard).
- **Efficiency & Cost Awareness** through [golden paths](/templates) and [reusable components](/docs/iac/concepts/components) optimized from the start.
- **Policy-Driven by Design** that enforces security, compliance, and cost [policies](/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/crossguard/get-started) automatically.
- **Cloud-Native Ready** ideal for ephemeral workloads, Kubernetes, and multi-cloud.

### Considerations

- **Newer Platform** with a smaller plugin ecosystem than Backstage's.
- **Infra-Heavy Focus** that's best fit for infra-intensive orgs; overpowered if you only need a catalog and docs.

## Real-World Outcomes

**Pulumi IDP Adoption**: [CLEAR leveraged Pulumi IDP's prebuilt capabilities](/events/from-infrastructure-engineering-to-platform-engineering) instead of building infra automation from scratch, speeding up delivery while keeping governance tight.

## Decision Guide

**Choose Backstage if you:**

- Have a dedicated platform team with strong React/TypeScript skills
- Primarily need service cataloging and documentation
- Already have robust infra provisioning and governance
- Have 18+ months and budget for ongoing maintenance

**Choose Pulumi IDP if you:**

- Need [infrastructure governance](/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/crossguard) from day one
- Want [cost](/blog/finops-with-pulumi) and [policy automation](/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/crossguard/get-started) built in
- Must scale efficiently across [Kubernetes](/docs/iac/clouds/kubernetes) and [multi-cloud](/docs/iac/concepts/how-pulumi-works)
- Prefer to avoid building everything from scratch

## The Shift to Infrastructure Platform Engineering

Platform engineering isn't failing because the idea is flawed. It's failing because too many efforts start with the portal and leave infrastructure for later.

Infrastructure Platform Engineering flips that model, ensuring the platform's foundation is:

- [Scalable](/blog/platform-engineering-pillars-4)
- [Governed](/blog/platform-engineering-pillars-7)
- [Cost-efficient](/blog/finops-with-pulumi)
- [Secure](/blog/integrating-devops-and-security-for-scalable-platform-engineering)

Hybrid approaches are also possible. Pulumi offers a [Backstage plugin](/docs/pulumi-cloud/developer-platforms) so teams can pair Backstage's portal features with Pulumi IDP's infrastructure power.

## Bottom Line

If your platform is slow, costly, or hard to govern, it's not a developer problem. It's an infrastructure problem.
Treating infrastructure as a first-class concern from day one isn't optional.
It's the difference between a platform that scales and one that stalls.
