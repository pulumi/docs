At Pulumi, we’re incredibly fortunate to have over 70 integration partners in our ecosystem – helping shared end-users to build, deploy and manage practically any cloud service they can imagine. Our most popular content often includes workshops that show end-users how to use these powerful integrations. This year for PulumiUP, we’re excited to announce that we’ve teamed up with a number of partners to deliver a workshop track that provides hands-on labs and demonstrations for a variety of platforms and scenarios.

Thursday, May 5th at 2:30 PM PDT

We’ll explain the basics of IaC by exploring how to use Pulumi to build, configure and deploy a real-life, modern application using Docker.

### From Zero to Production in Kubernetes

Tuesday, May 10th at 9:00 AM PDT

Our friends from NGINX will show you how to leverage the power of Python with Pulumi to define and manage your Kubernetes deployments and build powerful abstractions that make getting to production easier than ever before. You’ll learn about the new open-source Modern Application Reference Architecture (MARA) that helps you quickly deploy an app platform that includes Amazon EKS, NGINX Kubernetes ingress controller, logstore, logagent, cert-manager, Prometheus, Grafana, and more.

### Kubecrash

Tuesday, May 17th at 9:00 AM PDT

Join Pulumi and the maintainers of Linkerd, cert-manager, and other projects for a series of crash courses about Kubernetes and cloud-native, open source technologies.

### Getting Started with Azure and Infrastructure as Code
