The latest major release of the Azure Classic Pulumi Provider is available now!
Our 6.0 release contains the [latest upstream changes](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/releases/tag/v4.0.1) to keep you up-to-date along with the latest features and improvements from Pulumi.

The Azure Classic provider is derived from the upstream Terraform AzureRM provider and can be used to provision most resources on Azure. The Azure Classic provider can be used to complement the [Pulumi Azure Native provider](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/azure-native/), our recommended provider, which has amazing resource coverage due to being derived directly from the official specifications.
The provider is open source and available on GitHub so you can always follow along with current issues and developments, or even open your first pull request.

## Looking Back

Since the last major release of this provider, we have continuously shipped improvements to our ecosystem, bringing the latest Pulumi features to your production stack.
We have rolled out an [improved diffing strategy](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform-bridge/issues/1785) and [fixed state upgrades](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform-bridge/pull/2081) in the Pulumi Terraform Bridge, removing spurious diffs on preview and increasing confidence when deploying. Additionally we have improved accuracy and coverage for registry documentation, via better example conversion and [general docs improvements](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform-bridge/issues/1794) for bridged providers.
