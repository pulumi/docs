Organizations are under constant pressure to deliver new products and features faster than ever. But speed alone isn’t enough—businesses must also navigate the complex challenges of ensuring security and managing infrastructure costs effectively.

Enter DevSecOps - the strategic integration of security practices into the DevOps workflow. By automating security processes, organizations can achieve improved speed, scalability, and business impact, all while ensuring security remains a priority.

Tivity Health, a leading health and fitness solutions provider, has embraced this DevSecOps approach using Pulumi, a modern infrastructure as code (IaC) platform. During PulumiUP 2024, David Giambruno, Tivity Health's VP of Engineering and DevOps, shared how, by leveraging Pulumi, he led the transformation that continuously drives remarkable results in speed, cost savings, and security.

## The Beginning: From Data Center to the Cloud

[Tivity Health](https://www.tivityhealth.com/)'s journey began with a strategic decision to transition from a traditional data center environment to a cloud-native architecture. Rather than opting for a "lift and shift" approach, they made the bold choice to go directly to a cloud-native model, embracing the principles of DevSecOps along the way.

{{< youtube "35vAiKdDux4?rel=0" >}}

The need to [automate infrastructure deployment](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments/) and management was fundamental. Giambruno explained, "*If you can't automate it, we don't need it.*" This philosophy drove the team to seek out a solution that would not only streamline their operations but also empower their developers to focus on building innovative products for their customers.

## Embracing Pulumi: The Power of Automation, Productivity, and Security

Tivity Health's search for the right tool led them to Pulumi, a unified platform for all the infrastructure needs that allows teams to use general programming languages, such as TypeScript, Python, Java, and Go, to define and manage their cloud infrastructure. Giambruno and his team immediately recognized Pulumi's ability to deliver on their key requirements:

- **Automation**: [Pulumi's infrastructure as code (IaC)](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/) approach enabled Tivity Health to automate the deployment and management of its cloud environments, reducing the time and effort required for these tasks.
- **Productivity**: using Pulumi's general-purpose programming languages allowed developers to define, deploy, and manage infrastructure within their existing tools.
- **Security**: Pulumi's security features allowed Tivity Health to integrate [security practices](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/crossguard/) into its infrastructure deployment processes, reducing the risk of security breaches and ensuring compliance.
- **Cost Optimization**: Pulumi's ability to automate the spin-up and teardown of cloud environments on demand has led to significant cost reductions for Tivity Health.

Giambruno describes Pulumi as a "three-dimensional" tool, offering a versatile set of capabilities that have been instrumental in transforming Tivity Health's operations. "*The ability to use those dimensions in lots of different ways to do the automation is what really makes a difference to the teams*," he says.

## Driving Business Impact Through Security Automation

By adopting Pulumi and DevSecOps automation, Tivity Health realized significant business benefits:

- **Speed and Agility**: By automating its infrastructure deployment and management processes, Tivity Health has dramatically [reduced the time](https://www.pulumi.com/case-studies/unity/) required to spin up new environments or change existing ones. "*We run it through automation and boom, it's out, it's done*," Giambruno says. This newfound speed and agility have empowered Tivity Health's developers to focus on building products and features rather than getting bogged down in infrastructure-related tasks.
- **Cost Optimization**: Tivity Health's cloud-native approach and Pulumi's automation capabilities have resulted in [significant cost savings](https://www.pulumi.com/case-studies/lemonade/). The company estimates that its annual cloud spend has decreased from $9.5 million in its data center days to just $2 million—a staggering 79% reduction. These cost savings have allowed Tivity Health to redirect resources towards more strategic initiatives that drive business growth.
- **Improved Security and Compliance**: Tivity Health's DevSecOps strategy, anchored by Pulumi, has strengthened its security posture and [compliance efforts](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/crossguard/compliance-ready-policies/). By integrating security directly into its infrastructure workflows, Tivity Health has improved its security posture. Automation ensures that security measures are enforced consistently across their cloud environments, reducing risks and improving compliance.

## Fostering DevOps Culture Through Cross-Functional Collaboration

Using Pulumi provided more than technical benefits. It also enabled better collaboration between the development, security, and operations teams. By providing a common language and framework for infrastructure management, Pulumi has helped break down silos and align these traditionally disparate groups towards a shared goal of delivering secure, high-quality products faster.

## Lessons Learned: Navigating the Cultural Shift

Transitioning to DevSecOps and cloud-native practices required a cultural shift at Tivity Health. Giambrono acknowledges that this cultural shift was not without its challenges. He emphasizes the importance of addressing the human element of change, offering the following advice for organizations embarking on a similar journey:

- **Start with a proof of concepts**: Giambruno recommends beginning with a small-scale proof of concepts to demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of the new technologies and processes to help alleviate fears and build confidence among team members.
- **Empower developers and make them feel safe**: By involving developers in the process and ensuring they feel comfortable with the new tools and workflows, Tivity Health gained user buy-in and overall support for the new DevSecOps approach.
- **Secure buy-in from business and financial stakeholders**: Address the concerns of business and financial stakeholders early on, such as the impact on costs and the ability to deliver tangible results. This is crucial for securing the necessary support and resources.
- **Celebrate successes and build momentum**: Giambruno highlights the importance of celebrating the team's achievements along the way, even when there are bumps on the road, as this helps build enthusiasm and keep the momentum going.

## The Future of DevSecOps and Pulumi at Tivity Health

As Tivity Health continues to refine its DevSecOps strategy, Giambruno is optimistic about the future. He envisions a world where the company's ability to deploy new products and features rapidly will give Tivity Health a significant competitive edge, allowing it to better serve its customers and drive business growth.

Looking ahead, Giambruno is particularly enthusiastic about the potential of Pulumi's AI-powered capabilities, which he believes will further streamline and optimize the company's infrastructure management processes. "*I'm super looking forward to the tests we're going to do, like when we acquire someone and then taking them in, 'Borg-ing' them into our automation and seeing how much we can take out of their operating cost as fast as possible*," he says.

Tivity Health's journey with Pulumi is a powerful example of how the right tool, DevSecOps strategy, and automation can drive tangible business results. By focusing on automation, security, and collaboration, organizations can achieve faster, cheaper, and better cloud deployments—putting them on the path to long-term success in an increasingly competitive, cloud-native world.
