Today we’re excited to launch support for Customer-Managed Keys (CMKs) in Pulumi ESC. This feature gives your organization full control over how your secrets and state are encrypted — empowering you to meet the most demanding compliance requirements like HIPAA, GDPR, and FedRAMP, all while maintaining the ease-of-use that Pulumi is known for.

## Why Customer-Managed Keys?

Pulumi encrypts secrets and other sensitive information stored in ESC using data keys, which are encrypted with Pulumi-Managed Keys using strong security standards. However, customers might need to use their own keys to gain full control over their lifecycle and revocation, maintain a centralized audit trail, and enforce custom rotation policies. This is especially important to meet compliance requirements or specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP, etc). Customer-Managed Keys give customers that control while keeping these aspects transparent for the consumers of those secrets.

## How It Works

Customer-Managed Keys integrate seamlessly with your Pulumi Cloud Organization. Once enabled, all existing data keys used to encrypt your ESC secrets, previously encrypted with the Pulumi-managed key, will be automatically re-encrypted with the new CMK.

Setting it up takes just a few minutes:

1. **Create** a KMS key in your AWS account.  
2. **Grant Access** to the KMS key using OIDC in your AWS account.  
3. **Configure** your Pulumi Cloud organization to use your new KMS key.

## Available Today

Customer-Managed Keys with support for AWS KMS are available today for all organizations on the **Pulumi Enterprise** or **Business Critical** plans. You can set it up by following the instructions [in the Pulumi Cloud documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/admin/customer-managed-keys).

We expect to add support for more cloud providers in the future. Please vote on the following GitHub issues for your favorite to support prioritization:
