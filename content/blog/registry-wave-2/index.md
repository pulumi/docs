Pulumi is excited to announce the addition of 27 new providers to the Pulumi Registry, significantly expanding our ecosystem and empowering developers with more choices for infrastructure as code. This expansion includes providers like Temporal, Vantage, and Honeycomb, among many others, making it even easier to manage diverse cloud and SaaS services with Pulumi.

This milestone is made possible by Pulumi's new ability to use [any Terraform provider](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/terraform-provider/) (bridging existing Terraform providers for use in Pulumi), as detailed in our [recent blog post](/blog/any-terraform-provider/). Since that announcement, Pulumi users have already begun to use many of the new infrastructure and SaaS providers that are now accessible within the familiar Pulumi programming model. To ensure the best developer experience, we've also added comprehensive documentation for 27 of these new providers directly in the [Pulumi Registry](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/). This means you can find everything you need right where you're already spending time.
> "Developers thrive on tools that seamlessly integrate into their existing build, test, and deployment workflows. That’s why we’re excited to have Temporal included in the Pulumi Registry—making it effortless to create and manage Temporal resources alongside other critical infrastructure using the programming languages developers already know and love."  - Jay Sivachelvan,  VP of Partnerships - Temporal

This release represents just the first wave of our expanded provider documentation initiative. We've prioritized these initial 27 providers based on direct user and customer feedback. We're committed to continuing this effort, with plans to add documentation for many more providers to the Pulumi Registry in the coming months. Our goal is to create the most comprehensive and user-friendly infrastructure as code ecosystem, making it even easier for you to manage your entire cloud infrastructure from a single platform.

This update is designed with developers in mind and features enriched documentation directly in the Registry, ensuring you have all the resources you need right at your fingertips. We're also spotlighting a few partner providers:
  
- **Temporal** – Manage Temporal Cloud as code.
- **Vantage** – Gain cost visibility and optimize cloud spending.
- **Honeycomb** – Seamlessly integrate observability best practices.
- **Timescale** – Time series and real time analytics on PostgreSQL.

> "Timescale Cloud brings high-performance PostgreSQL to time-series, real-time analytics, and AI workloads, now with a seamless Pulumi integration. Developers can deploy and manage their infrastructure using their preferred language, making it easier than ever to scale PostgreSQL without resource-management headaches." - Mike Freedman, CTO - Timescale
