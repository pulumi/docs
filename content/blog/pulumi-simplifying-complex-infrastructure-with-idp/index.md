summary: |
  This approach to using Pulumi Internal Developer Platform (IDP) gives developers the flexibility they need in language and logic while presenting end users with a simple, abstracted YAML template. This post details Pulumi’s complex self-hosted EKS installer redesigned as a modular system built with IDP components and templates. Leveraging IDP this way preserves developer flexibility behind the scenes, while templates are easily delivered and deployed through the Pulumi UI or CLI—providing platform users with a clean, repeatable, and simplified deployment experience.
