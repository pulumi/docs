Pulumi stands with the open source community.

We are unaffected by HashiCorp relicensing their software yesterday, and express profound support for many of our cloud friends who have been affected.

Pulumi is [true open source](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi), uses the Apache 2.0 license, and does not and never will depend on BSL-licensed software in any way, HashiCorp owned or otherwise.

We look forward to continuing to serve our [new](https://app.pulumi.com/signup) and loyal customers, always with open source and our amazing, fast-growing community at our core.
