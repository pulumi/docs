One of Pulumi's core features is the ability to [model infrastructure](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/) using well-traveled, familiar general-purpose programming languages. Today, we're thrilled to announce that Java, one of the world's most popular programming languages, is now generally available in Pulumi. This release joins our existing first-class support for TypeScript, Python, Go, YAML, and C#, enabling Java developers to manage cloud infrastructure using the language they know and trust.

We introduced Java in preview in 2022. Since then, we’ve grown our Java support based on feedback from the expanding set of companies that have adopted Pulumi Java in production workloads. Let’s look at some examples of using Java to power your Pulumi programs.

## Familiar Composability

Using Java with Pulumi lets you model your infrastructure using familiar patterns. Paired with our rich abstractions, you can efficiently build Pulumi programs. For instance, let’s take a look at an example from our docs that shows how, in a few lines of code, you can:

1. Instantiate and override the defaults for the default Pulumi AWS Provider

```java
var useast1 = new Provider("useast1",
        ProviderArgs.builder().region("us-east-1").build());
```

2. Define an ACM certificate, passing along the defaults defined in Step 1

```java
var cert = new Certificate("cert",
   CertificateArgs.builder()
       .domainName("pulumi.com")
       .validationMethod("EMAIL")
       .build(),
   CustomResourceOptions.builder()
       .provider(useast1)
       .build());
```

3. Instantiate an ELB listener, injecting the cert from above

```java
var listener = new Listener("listener",
       ListenerArgs.builder()
           .loadBalancerArn(loadBalancerArn)
           .port(443)
           .protocol("HTTPS")
           .sslPolicy("ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08")
           .certificateArn(cert.arn())
           .defaultActions(ListenerDefaultActionArgs.builder()
                   .targetGroupArn(targetGroupArn)
                   .type("forward")
                   .build())
           .build());
```

With just a few lines of code (especially by Java standards), we were able to use out-of-the-box abstractions (Pulumi providers) and the builder pattern (a Java favorite) to compose a set of strongly typed, easy-to-reason about resources.

## Automation Abstractions with the Pulumi Automation API

With the introduction of Java 1.0, we’re also excited to announce that the [Automation API](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/using-pulumi/automation-api/) is now supported in Java. The Automation API is a fully typed SDK that allows you to interact with Pulumi programs outside the Pulumi CLI. You can directly access and orchestrate your Pulumi projects and stacks with the SDK. This allows you to integrate Pulumi into other systems, such as CI/CD pipelines or internal tooling.

```java

```

## Get Started with Pulumi Java

To learn more about and to get started with Pulumi Java, you can check out the following resources:

* [Java SDK Repo](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java): The Java SDK is fully open-source, and we’re excited to get your feedback or review any pull requests.

* [Examples Repo](https://github.com/pulumi/examples): The Pulumi examples repo has many examples of Pulumi Java programs to help you get up and running with Pulumi Java.

* [Pulumi Java Converter](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/adopting-pulumi/converters/): The Pulumi converter tool efficiently migrates existing IaC applications, such as Terraform, ARM, and Bicep, to Pulumi Java.
