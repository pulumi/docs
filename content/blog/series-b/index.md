Today I'm thrilled to [announce](https://info.pulumi.com/press-release/series-b-announcement) that we've raised $37.5 million in Series B funding led by NEA with participation from existing investors, Madrona Venture Group and Tola Capital. We will use this funding to continue serving our fast-growing community of developers and infrastructure practitioners, making Cloud Engineering the new reality for organizations embracing the modern cloud in all aspects of how they ship software.

## Our vision for the modern cloud era

All software is cloud software, all developers are cloud developers, and infrastructure teams enable innovation. This is Cloud Engineering. The cloud has become a competitive advantage for many companies, enabling new disruptive business models and end user experiences. Pulumi is right at the forefront of enabling this new way of building.

We set out over three years ago to fundamentally rethink how teams create cloud software, with a belief that by standing on the shoulders of giants &mdash; applying our industry's best languages, tools, and ecosystems to infrastructure &mdash; we could build a platform that uniquely enables developers and infrastructure experts alike to leverage the cloud in new ways. Despite having created languages like C# and TypeScript in our past lives, it struck our founding team that the world didn't need another programming language, DSL, or YAML templating solution &mdash; that, instead, we could unleash innovation by embracing the very languages our industry already knows and loves.

That led to Pulumi's [unique approach to infrastructure as code](/docs/) &mdash; something we often call "infrastructure as software." Bring your own language, fire up your favorite editor, get full access to any or many clouds of your choice, and code away. Use standard libraries, package up and share and reuse your own best practices, or benefit from the community's shared knowledge. Tap into all the goodness surrounding that language including [familiar engineering superpowers](/superpowers/) like refactoring, interactive documentation and error checking in your IDE, debugging, test frameworks, and tools like code formatters and linters. All the while still getting the belts and suspenders of infrastructure as code: plan deployments by previewing them before they happen, get a full history of who deployed what and when, enforce security, compliance, and cost controls using policy as code, and more, all open source with an easy to use, but optional, SaaS backend.

In addition to turbocharging infrastructure as code, this new approach has given way to entirely new approaches to programmable infrastructure. The day that AWS put a REST API in front of spinning up a new virtual machine, the world changed irreversibly forever. By having an entire programming and resource model for interacting with cloud infrastructure, we can finally layer abstractions on top, as we've done for decades with hardware. As a preview of things to come, [check out our new Automation API](/blog/automation-api/), for example, something that simply isn't possible with traditional infrastructure as code approaches that are syntactic sugar on top of primitive YAML, JSON, or DSL targets.

We also took an approach of integrating with an ecosystem of incredible partners. Pulumi now supports [over 50 infrastructure providers](/docs/reference/pkg/) including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, Alibaba, Auth0, Cloudflare, Datadog, Fastly, GitHub, GitLab, MongoDB, New Relic, and more; [over a dozen CI/CD integrations](/docs/guides/continuous-delivery/) including Azure DevOps, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Octopus Deploy, and Spinnaker, for seamless and continuous delivery; and many identity providers, including Atlassian, Azure Active Directory, G Suite, GitHub, GitLab, and Okta. We [embraced the Kubernetes ecosystem](/docs/guides/crosswalk/kubernetes/) from day one, with great support for the entire Kubernetes API, managed clusters in all the major clouds (AWS EKS, AKS, GKE, etc.), Helm 2 and 3, Kustomize, Open Policy Agent (OPA)'s Rego language for policy as code, and a Kubernetes Operator, to name a few key features that are helping customers go to production with Pulumi and Kubernetes.

When we were starting, we often heard that infrastructure is "too boring" or that general purpose languages instead of YAML was "too powerful." On the contrary, infrastructure has become an essential software building block that can be programmed and assembled to build bigger things out of smaller things, and my own career pursuing lovable and productive developer experiences is that the builders, when empowered, will dream big, innovate, and exceed your own imagination of what was possible.

Three years later, I am happy to say that this is exactly what's happened. [Hundreds of customers](/case-studies/) and tens of thousands of end users have used Pulumi to harness the cloud to build mind-blowingly innovative solutions that are rich, reliable, and secure by-construction. Entire companies are building their infrastructure platforms using Pulumi and enabling the whole team to move at record pace with confidence.

## Cloud Engineering is here &mdash; and growing fast

Cloud Engineering extends beyond Pulumi. Last month, thousands of us tuned in to listen to dozens of industry expert leaders and practitioners at [our first annual Cloud Engineering Summit](https://cloudengineeringsummit.com). Two things are clear: first, Cloud Engineering is already here and here to stay in a major way, and, second, it is rapidly becoming the de facto way that the most innovative software teams in the world are working together.

At the time we conceived of Pulumi, there was significant fragmentation, uncertainty, and difficulty in adopting Kubernetes, Serverless, Docker, and continuous delivery for production workloads. Fast forward to today, and we can now rely on stable container orchestrators, including Kubernetes, as standard container schedulers across all the major cloud providers, SRE is widely adopted, most organizations are adopting daily delivery of new software releases, and it's clear that the answer is mixed workloads of containers, serverless, and VMs are a permanent reality for most teams for good architectural reasons. Teams are now looking for solutions to go from idea to production faster than ever before, and Cloud Engineering is emerging as the way to do just that.

There's no doubt we'll keep seeing more innovation, and therefore many more tools and technologies pop up in the space. Cloud Engineering teams need standard platforms and workflows to tame the complexity of cloud infrastructure building blocks as they build cloud native, distributed applications. "Walls of YAML and mountains of Bash" has led to ad-hoc approaches that simply are not scaling to this new level of speed and complexity. We've also heard from customers that they're looking for cloud agnostic solutions given the reality of multi-cloud, whether because they need to ship to two major cloud providers, manage Kubernetes resources with infrastructure as code techniques, and/or incorporate great SaaS infrastructure services like Cloudflare, Datadog, MailChimp, or MongoDB alongside their cloud infrastructure.

Every organization needs a Cloud Engineering Platform, and we are happy to be that very solution for some of the world's most innovative companies. We look forward to helping more and more customers innovate and win in their own industries as Cloud Engineering continues to emerge as a leading best practice.

## What's next?

We remain focused on Pulumi's mission to enable Cloud Engineering by empowering Cloud Engineers of all backgrounds to collaborate and do their best work together. We have made incredible progress in three years, and we're just getting started.

So, where do we go from here?

Pulumi's infrastructure as code platform has made a significant step towards democratizing access to cloud infrastructure. The cloud is immensely powerful &mdash; and yet it can often still be too difficult to fully utilize. Although all software is becoming cloud software in a meaningful way, the cloud's capabilities aren't yet as easy to program as a standard operating system's are. Pulumi aims to deliver that radical simplification.

We will continue obsessing over your success with cloud applications and infrastructure, ensuring Pulumi is the best infrastructure as code choice available. Features like the Automation API are enabling groundbreaking ways to use cloud infrastructure, powering entire platforms that themselves are powering entire organizations and new cloud products. We are also hard at work creating libraries with built-in best practices, and new workshops and educational material, to make the cloud easier to use than ever before.

This foundation also enables new and exciting product experiences. As Pulumi increasingly becomes the Cloud Engineering Platform that powers your organization, we will accelerate bringing Cloud Engineering to all practitioners and teams worldwide. We really do believe that all software is cloud software, all developers are cloud developers, and that infrastructure teams are central to enabling this innovation &mdash; and this Series B fundraise will help to ensure that we realize the full potential of that vision!

I'd like to take a moment to thank our customers. Our community has grown into an inclusive and collaborative place, reflecting our own company values. One of those values says, "our own success is directly enabled by the success of our customers," which we remember every day by helping you move fast and innovate. We could not have it without you &mdash; thank you, again &mdash; you will continue to be our guiding light for the future.

To the clouds and beyond!

Joe
