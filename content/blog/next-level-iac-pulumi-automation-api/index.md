When I am talking with community members, who are not using Pulumi yet, I often get asked what would be a good way to include their Infrastructure as Code (IaC) into existing software like a REST API. And my answer is always the same: Use our [Pulumi Automation API](/docs/using-pulumi/automation-api/).

With the Pulumi Automation API you can include Pulumi IaC into your existing software, and this for any of the Pulumi supported programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Go, or C#. This gives you a greater flexibility and control, which you will not have with other IaC tools like CloudFormation or Terraform.

This opens up many doors of opportunity to expose your services as an API, whether internally to your organization or externally to your potential customers. This opportunity for innovation fuels what is known as the [API Economy](https://konghq.com/blog/enterprise/api-economy).

## What is API Economy?

![API Economy](api-economy.png)

As a matter of fact: — APIs enable innovation.

> Over [40% of large organizations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patricksalyer/2021/05/04/api-stack-the-billion-dollar-opportunities-redefining-infrastructure-services--platforms/?sh=2d6c47f043f9) have 250+ APIs. And 71% plan to use even more APIs this year.

API Economy is a term that is used to describe the way that organizations are using APIs to create new business models and revenue streams. APIs are the building blocks of modern software development, and they allow developers to build on  top of existing services and create new services that are greater than the sum of their parts.

Major international corporations leveraging the API economy through robust API strategies include Google, Amazon, Stripe, Twilio, Slack, and many other renowned brands. Google's initial Maps service, for instance, has evolved into a comprehensive platform offering Maps, Routes, and Places APIs and SDKs. These tools enable companies to incorporate both dynamic and static maps into their applications and websites, offer navigational guidance, access 360° Street View images, utilize geolocation services, and more. This transformation exemplifies the concept of value multiplication in the API economy, as described by [Gartner Vice President Kristin Moyer](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/welcome-to-the-api-economy):

> "The API economy is an enabler for turning a business or organisation into a platform. Platforms multiply value creation because they enable business ecosystems inside and outside of the enterprise to consummate matches among users and facilitate the creation and exchange of goods, services and social currency so that all participants are able to capture value."

## What is Pulumi Automation API in a nutshell?

Pulumi Automation API is a set of SDKs that allow you to interact with your Pulumi stacks programmatically. This means that you can use the Automation API to create, update, and delete stacks, as well as to query their current state. The Automation API is built on top of the Pulumi engine, which means that it is fully compatible with all of the existing Pulumi providers and resources.

And it is this capability that allows you to build your own Service API on top of Pulumi. We can now build a REST or gRPC API endpoint that, depending on the request parameters, will create, update, or delete a Pulumi stack. This API can then be exposed to the rest of the organization, allowing developers to interact with their infrastructure in a programmatic way.

## How to build your own Service API with Pulumi Automation API?

Let's take a look at how you can build your own Service API with Pulumi Automation API.

For this purpose, we will build two basic REST services written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Let us run the above Python example in a FastAPI server to see how the Automation API works in practice.

Let's start by creating a new Python file called `main.py` and pasting the above code into it. Next, we need to install the required dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv ven
source venv/bin/activate
```
Create a new file called `requirements.txt` and paste the following dependencies into it:

```bash
pulumi
fastapi
pydantic
```

We need to install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

Finally, we can run the FastAPI server using the following command:

```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```

This will start the FastAPI server on port 8000.

To test the REST services, you can use a tool like `curl` or Postman. Here is an example of how you can create a new stack using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "myexample", "org": "myorg", "project": "myproject", "stack": "mystack", "region": "us-west-2"}' http://localhost:3000
```

In the logs of the FastAPI server, you should see following output from the Automation API:

```bash

You should see the URL of the created infrastructure in the response from the FastAPI server. If you head over to the [Pulumi console](https://app.pulumi.com/), you should see the created stack and the resources that were created and also that [Pulumi Deployments](/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments/) were used to deploy the stack to the specified AWS region.

## Next Steps

Now that we have our basic REST services, we can deploy them on a server (using a service like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions) and expose them to the rest of the organization via an API Gateway. In parallel you can publish release notes and documentation to your organization, so that they can start using your new Service API.

One way could be to create an OpenAPI specification for your Service API and use a tool like Swagger to generate a client library for your organization. This way, developers can interact with your Service API in a programmatic way, without having to write any code.

Here is an example of an OpenAPI specification for our Service API:

```yaml

## Conclusion


In this blog post, we've explored how Pulumi's Automation API can be used to build and expose a Service API within your organization. By embedding Pulumi as a library in any application, you can drive your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments directly through code. This sets Pulumi apart from other tools like Terraform, which relies on static configuration files and a command-line interface.

Additionally, we touched on the concept of the API economy, where APIs are leveraged to connect services, accelerate product delivery, and drive business value through the possibilities of creating new touchpoints. The Pulumi Automation API is the perfect piece of technology, which makes it now possible to define, deploy, and manage infrastructure programmatically as part of your API strategy.

I hope this blog post has inspired you with ideas on how to take your IaC to the next level, making it more accessible and practical for your organization.
