ðŸ‘‹I'm Tasia, a Computer Science student at the University of Washington, and Pulumi's first very first intern! Read on to learn about some of my thoughts and experiences from these past few months.

## Why Pulumi?

I've interned at a few different companies before, but for my last internship, there were a several things I was looking for:
- A start-up. All the companies I worked at previously had at least a couple thousand people, and I wanted to see first-hand the difference in both engineering and culture between larger, more established companies and smaller, newer ones.
- A knowledgable engineering team. Although I knew I wanted to work at a start-up, I also wanted access to the knowledge and expertise that usually comes with more senior engineers.
- A product I can get behind. There's a lot of start-ups out there, and not all of them work on things that I think are viable or exciting. Working on something that I can see myself and others using makes getting up for work a little more bearable.
- Competitive compensation. Even though I don't expect smaller companies to be as financially well-off as the other companies I worked for, I still wanted to be paid comparably. 
- Opportunities to learn something new. My main goal for all of my internships is basically just to learn something new. I don't really know what I want to do for the rest of my career, but the best way I think to figure that out is to try a bit of everything!

If you haven't guessed already, Pulumi checks all of these boxes! Although Pulumi was only founded a few years ago, their team is rich with experienced engineers and their product has taken a foothold in companies all over the world. Especially with the release of 2.0 right around the corner, I'm glad I joined at such an exciting time.

## Working Across the Company

Pulumi engineering is currently split up into two teams: the *Service* Team and the *Platform* Team. The service team primarily works on the [Pulumi Console](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/console/), whereas the platform team primarily works on the [Pulumi SDK](https://www.pulumi.com/product/#sdk). Although I'm technically a part of the Service Team, one of the benefits of working as an intern in a small company is the flexibility to work on projects across the whole company.

Within the Service Team, I added [support for tags](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-service-improvements_02-2020/#first-class-support-for-tags) within the Pulumi Console and created new pages to [view a member's specific stack permissions](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-service-improvements_02-2020/#first-class-support-for-tags). Within the Platform Team, I added support for both [transformations](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#transformations) and [Docker images](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-docker/pull/147) in Go. Lastly, in a cross-team effort, I've been helping out with updating our [docs](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/) for Pulumi 2.0!

Simply put, I took on the work of a full-time engineer, only with slightly more flexibility and a lot less experience. Prior to working at Pulumi, I had basically zero knowledge on Angular, cloud providers, and code generation. Now, I'm still nowhere near an expert, but I feel like I have a stronger grasp on where the software engineering industry is headed, thanks to the help of everyone I worked with!

## Final Thoughts

Overall, my time at Pulumi wasn't quite the chaotic startup experience I was expecting. I had a wide range of meaningful projects, a lot of support from other engineers, and more flexibility than I would have expected as an intern. Looking back, the only major differences I felt while working at Pulumi (both engineering-related and otherwise) compared to my previous companies were the lack of free meals (which as a college student, I'm very partial to) and intern events (which as the only intern, I didn't expect any of), which I think really speaks to the maturity of their engineering and leadership teams. Granted, this quarter was a little weird due to some [unforseen circumstances](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/coronavirus-plan/), but even still, my internship went by pretty smoothly and I'm proud seeing how much I've accomplished.

## Conclusion

I'm soon returning to (virtual) classes (thanks, coronavirus!), but feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastasiahalim/) to learn more about me and/or my experiences!
