## The Importance of Open Source

Your DevOps team drives the technology and tooling choices that build production. The benefits of open source mean that even in enterprise-grade environments, they increasingly choose an open-source tool over a closed-source option. Large communities of maintainers and other users, great documentation, and personalized support make open source an extremely appealing choice.

This means that open source software has become the backbone of any modern tech stack. That rapidly-increasing reliance on open source means that any development team needs the skills to understand and effectively utilize these tools to remain on top. The KubeCrash event is tailor-made for this, with sessions and hands-on workshops for SREs, developers, platform engineers, and security engineers hosted by the maintainers of some of the most popular open source tools in the cloud native landscape.

## About KubeCrash

Our inaugural KubeCrash event, held alongside KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, was a resounding success. This year, we’re making it even better with feedback from all of you!
KubeCrash Fall will be held before KubeCon, with two half-day events held in different timezones to accommodate everyone. You’ll be able to interact with speakers and other participants live, no matter where you are! One event will be held from 3pm to 6pm Central European Time, and the next will be held from 9am to 12pm US Pacific Time.
KubeCrash is a collaborative effort by seven different open source companies in the cloud native space, all of us coming together to bring you high-quality crash courses on cloud native technologies before KubeCon. We aren’t here to sell you anything or make you sit through pitches; you’ll get content on Pulumi, and also other cool open source projects like Goldilocks, cert-manager, Linkerd, CockroachDB, and Polaris.
