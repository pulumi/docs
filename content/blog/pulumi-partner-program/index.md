We are thrilled to announce the launch of the [Pulumi Partner Program](www.pulumi.com/partners), a strategic initiative designed to empower our partners and their customers to accelerate cloud projects and achieve faster time-to-market. This program is crafted for cloud and SaaS companies for building, integrating, and going to market with Pulumi, enhancing their ability to deliver innovative solutions for their customers.

## Why the Pulumi Partner Program?

Pulumi has always been committed to the open-source community and the vibrant ecosystem that has grown around our products. With nearly [200 integrations](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/) today, our ecosystem is thriving, supported by a network of service partners focused on helping customers succeed. The Pulumi Partner Program is being developed to formalize and strengthen these relationships, allowing us to scale our ability to deliver seamless integrations, co-developed solutions, and collaborative go-to-market strategies. By building this program, we aim to empower partners to better support our mutual customers, accelerate cloud adoption, and provide tailored solutions that meet the unique needs of each organization. This structured approach ensures faster time to value for customers, while helping partners extend their reach and enhance their offerings.

Customers are choosing Pulumi because it enables them to manage cloud and SaaS resources using familiar general-purpose programming languages like Python, TypeScript, and Go. This approach taps into the existing skills of development teams, reducing the learning curve, and also allows for greater flexibility and reuse of code across projects. By utilizing these widely adopted languages, Pulumi increases team productivity, enables more robust automation, and significantly accelerates the path to production compared to infrastructure as code written in more restrictive, domain-specific languages. With the introduction of ["local packages”](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/any-terraform-provider/), we’re further simplifying the integration process for partners, facilitating seamless adoption and faster delivery of cloud projects.
