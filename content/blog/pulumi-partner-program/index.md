We are excited to announce the launch of the [Pulumi Partner Program](https://www.pulumi.com/partners/), a strategic initiative designed to empower our partners and their customers to accelerate cloud projects and achieve faster time-to-market. This program is crafted for cloud and SaaS companies who are building, integrating, and going to market with Pulumi.

Hear from dozens of partners and customers who automate, secure and manage everything in the cloud at PulumiUP on Wednesday, September 18. Register [here](https://www.pulumi.com/pulumi-up/?utm_source=member_desktop&utm_medium=referral_pulumi&utm_campaign=FY2025Q1_Event_PulumiUP).

## Why the Pulumi Partner Program?

Pulumi has always been committed to the open-source community and the vibrant ecosystem that has grown around our products. With nearly [200 integrations](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/) today, our ecosystem is thriving, supported by a network of service partners focused on helping customers succeed. The Pulumi Partner Program is being developed to formalize and strengthen these relationships, allowing us to scale our ability to deliver seamless integrations, co-developed solutions, and collaborative go-to-market activities. By building this program, we aim to empower partners to better support our mutual customers, accelerate cloud adoption, and provide tailored solutions that meet the unique needs of each organization.

Customers are choosing Pulumi because it enables them to manage cloud resources and secrets using familiar general-purpose programming languages like Python, TypeScript, .NET, Java and Go. This approach taps into the existing skills of development teams, reducing the learning curve, and also allows for greater flexibility and reuse of code across projects. By utilizing these widely adopted languages, Pulumi increases team productivity, enables more robust automation, and significantly accelerates the path to production compared to tools that require more restrictive, domain-specific languages. With the introduction of [local packages](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/any-terraform-provider/), we’re further simplifying the integration process for partners, facilitating seamless adoption and faster delivery of cloud projects.

## Key Benefits of Pulumi Partner Program

* __Empower Your Customers__ to deliver cloud initiatives faster using Pulumi’s Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Secrets Management capabilities. By partnering with Pulumi, your customers gain access to best automation for their cloud projects.
* __Accelerate Adoption__ of your solutions through seamless integration with Pulumi. Leverage Pulumi's support for the world's most popular programming languages and developer tools to streamline integration, making it easier for your customers to use and adopt your products using familiar languages, tools and process.
* __Reach More Developers__ with collaborative documentation, shared examples, and co-marketing initiatives to raise awareness. Participate in joint marketing efforts, including co-branded campaigns and events, to connect with more developers and platform engineers.

With 20 inaugural members, our technology partners join an elite community that benefits from Pulumi’s ongoing investment in technical, marketing, training, and business strategy support. We are excited to welcome new members such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com/), [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), [Dagger](https://dagger.io/) and many others.
