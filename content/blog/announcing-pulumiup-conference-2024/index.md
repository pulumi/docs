You'll hear keynotes from Pulumi Founder/CEO Joe Duffy and CTO Luke Hoban, stories from industry leaders on their experiences with cloud adoption and transformation (and how they used Pulumi to make it happen), and talks from other members of the Pulumi community (like you!) aimed at helping you navigate the ever-changing world of the cloud.

## Call for Speakers: Your Story Matters

One exciting addition to this year's event is the call for speakers. We invite you, the community, to share your stories, experiences, and expertise with fellow attendees.
