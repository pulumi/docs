    subtitle: Modern IaC and secrets management
    description: |
        Pulumi empowers organizations to automate AWS cloud infrastructure through code, tame secrets sprawl through centralized secrets management, and manage cloud assets and compliance with the help of AI. Pulumi encourages infrastructure, platform, development, DevOps, and security teams to collaborate and accelerates time to market with greater control and minimized risk.

# Pulumi’s [infrastructure as code](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/)
# SDK enables you to build, deploy, and manage your AWS infrastructure faster
# and with more confidence, using modern programming languages and software engineering
# practices. Leverage the full expressivity of general-purpose languages ([TypeScript/JavaScript](/docs/languages-sdks/javascript/),
# [Python](/docs/languages-sdks/python/), [Go](/docs/languages-sdks/go/), [C#](/docs/languages-sdks/dotnet/), [Java](/docs/languages-sdks/java/)
# or use markup languages (e.g., [YAML](/docs/languages-sdks/yaml/), CUE) to build any cloud architecture including containers, serverless, and server-based.

      subtitle: Tame secrets sprawl and configuration complexity
      description: |
        [Secrets](/docs/iac/concepts/secrets/) sprawl can lead to security breaches. Pulumi ESC provides centralized environments, secrets, and configuration management and orchestration that helps streamline operations, improve traceability, and ensure consistent security practices.

      points:
        - header: Stop secrets sprawl
          body: Pull and sync secrets and configuration with any secrets store – AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and more – and consume in any application, tool, or CI/CD platform.
        - header: Trust (and prove) your secrets are secure
          body: Adopt dynamic, short-lived secrets on demand as a best practice. Lock down every environment with [role-based access controls](/docs/pulumi-cloud/admin/organizations/#organization-roles), [versioning](/docs/esc/environments/versioning/), and a full audit log of all changes.
        - header: Ditch .env files
          body: No more copying-and-pasting secrets or storing them in plaintext on dev computers. Easily access secrets via CLI, API, Kubernetes operator, the Pulumi Cloud UI, and SDKs.
    - title: Manage
      icon: testing
      color: blue
      subtitle: Gain full auditability and visibility into all your environments to tame complexity and put security first
      description: Manage cloud infrastructure with dashboards that provide visibility into your infrastructure and any changes, [role-based access controls](/docs/pulumi-cloud/admin/organizations/#organization-roles), and [Policy as Code](/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/crossguard/) enforcement across your organization.

        - header: Converse about your infrastructure
          body: |
            [Pulumi Copilot](/product/copilot/) makes discovering cost savings, running compliance checks, and debugging deployments across your Kubernetes resources as easy as typing a question.
        - header: Enforce compliance
          body: Enable [Policy as Code](/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/crossguard/) within your organization so that you can define guardrails for your infrastructure, ensuring engineers are following best practices and putting security first. This helps you prevent mistakes before they occur and respond rapidly to any incidents.
        - header: Clear visibility across AWS resources
          body: Ask any questions about your AWS infrastructure. Pulumi Insights helps you find that needle in the haystack – locating a single resource across regions and accounts. See every resource running in each stack with deep links to the AWS Console, actions performed by team members, Git-like diffs for infrastructure changes, and much more.

automation_api:
    header: Programmatic Infrastructure as Code
    body: Pulumi [Automation API](/automation/) exposes the full power of infrastructure as code through a programmatic interface, instead of through CLI commands. Automation API lets you use the Pulumi engine as an SDK, enabling you to create software that can create, update, configure, and destroy infrastructure dynamically. This enables you to build custom cloud interfaces that are tailored to your team, organization, or customers.

crosswalk: 
    header: Use Well-Architected Practices
    body: Pulumi Crosswalk for AWS is a collection of libraries that use automatic well-architected best practices to make common infrastructure-as-code tasks in AWS easier and more secure. Secure and cost-conscious defaults are chosen so that simple programs automatically use best practices for the underlying infrastructure, enabling better productivity with confidence.
    points:
        - header: Deploy CDK Constructs with Pulumi
          body: You can deploy any AWS CDK construct from within a Pulumi deployment. If you're already using AWS CDK, you can now use Pulumi to orchestrate deployments instead of CloudFormation. This gives you [improved deployment speed](/case-studies/panther-labs/#proving-pulumis-advantages/) and integration with all features of Pulumi (like [Policy as Code](/docs/using-pulumi/crossguard/), [Audit Logs](/docs/pulumi-cloud/audit-logs/), Secrets, and much more).
        - header: Application and Infrastructure Together
          body: Crosswalk enables you to blur the lines between application and infrastructure code enabling you to author an entire full-stack application in one program. With support for inline Lambda functions and ease-of-use helper functions, building robust applications on AWS has never been easier.

            We are building a distributed-database-as-a-service product that runs on Kubernetes clusters across
            multiple public clouds including Google Cloud, AWS and others. Pulumi's declarative model, the support for real
            programming languages, and the uniform workflow on any cloud make our SRE team much more efficient.
