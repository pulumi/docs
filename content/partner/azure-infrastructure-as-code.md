    title: Improve your cloud application knowledge with your existing programming skills
    description: |
        If you’re a developer building on Microsoft Azure, then you’ve probably encountered challenges deploying cloud applications. With over 200 services, it can be difficult to know where to start.

        What if you could radically simplify building on Azure by using your existing programming knowledge, software tools, and software engineering principles? Enter [Infrastructure as Code](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/).
