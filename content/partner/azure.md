    Whether you're new to Microsoft Azure or already using it to manage your infrastructure, Pulumi makes getting started easy. If you're just starting out, you can write your infrastructure code using the Pulumi Azure SDK. Or if you're already managing resources with Azure, you can deploy an existing ARM template using Pulumi or you can rewrite the ARM template JSON in a programming language, either entirely, or one resource at a time.

    If you can deploy a resource with ARM templates, you can deploy it with the Pulumi Azure provider!

        The Pulumi Azure provider covers 100% of the resources available in Azure
        Resource Manager giving you the full power of Azure at your fingertips. Every
        property of each resource is always represented in the SDKs.

  - title: Always Up to Date
    description: |
        Pulumi's Microsoft Azure provider is designed to stay up-to-date with additions and changes
        to Azure APIs. The `azure-native` SDK is generated automatically from the Azure API
        specifications published by Microsoft, which means you'll always have access to the latest
        Azure features and improvements.

        - title: Familiar Concepts
          description: Azure Resource Manager API is structured around Resource Providers &mdash; high-level groups like `storage`, `compute`, or `web`. We map Resource Providers to top-level modules or namespaces in Pulumi SDKs.
          icon: fa-users

        - title: API Versions
          description: Each resource provider defines one or more API versions, for example, `2015-05-01`, `2020-09-01`, or `2020-08-01-preview`. Every version of every ARM API is available in Pulumi SDKs, and each version has its own module or namespace.

        - title: All Languages
          description: The Pulumi Azure provider is available in all Pulumi languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, and .NET Core. All SDKs are open source on GitHub and available as npm, NuGet, PyPI, and Go modules.
