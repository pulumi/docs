    Manage all your secrets and configuration at scale

overview:
    header: One interface for all your secrets
    body: |
      Pulumi ESC (Environments, Secrets, Configuration) centralizes secrets from every vault and cloud provider. No more juggling AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and Azure Key Vault separately. Connect them all, manage them centrally, access them anywhere.

      - **Eliminate secrets sprawl.** Connect to any secrets store—HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, 1Password, and more. One interface for all your secrets.
      - **Secure by default.** Dynamic, short-lived credentials with OIDC. Full RBAC, versioning, and audit logging. No more plaintext secrets anywhere.
      - **Engineer-friendly access.** CLI, API, SDKs, and Kubernetes operators. Access secrets from anywhere without compromising security.
      - **Integrated with Pulumi IaC.** Native integration with Pulumi infrastructure code, or use standalone with any application or workflow.
