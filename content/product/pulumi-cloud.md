              description: |
                Pulumi Cloud is a fully managed service for [infrastructure as code](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/). Store your infrastructure’s state for any cloud in Pulumi's secure backend, which has built-in scaling, availability, and fault tolerance. You also get access to granular access controls, CICD integrations, SAML/SCIM, audit logging, and more.

              more_info: |
                Allow developers to safely deploy in parallel with concurrent state-locking.

                Audit changes or rollback to previous versions with a [complete history](/docs/iac/concepts/state-and-backends/#checkpoints) of your state.

            - title: Manage infrastructure secrets and configuration
              description: |
                Use built-in [secrets management](/what-is/what-is-secrets-management/) for encrypted data such as credentials or tokens. Store and manage collections of config in [Pulumi ESC](/product/esc) into environment groupings.

              more_info: |
                Your infrastructure [state is encrypted](/docs/iac/concepts/state-and-backends/#state-encryption) in transit and at rest.

                Sensitive configurations (e.g. database passwords, cloud tokens) are [stored as secrets](/docs/concepts/secrets/).

                Use Pulumi's secrets manager or integrate with AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google KMS, and HashiCorp Vault.
            - title: IaC as a programmatic interface
              description: |
                With [Automation API](/automation),  you can use the Pulumi engine as a strongly typed SDK in your application code, enabling it to call functions that can provision and configure infrastructure on any cloud.

              more_info: |
                Automation API enables you to build custom cloud interfaces for your technical end users. For example, build self-service developer portals, CLIs, frameworks, and CI/CD workflows.

                Easily build high-scale, SaaS applications that serve customers with single-tenant instances. Automate creating and managing infrastructure for thousands of unique customers.
            - title: Software delivery integrations
              description: |
                Integrate Pulumi with your software delivery pipeline so that you can version, build, test, and deploy infrastructure code like software.

              more_info: |
                Work with existing tools like IDEs, test frameworks, and package managers.

                Integrate your [source control system](/docs/pulumi-cloud/deployments/ci-cd-integration-assistant/) so teams can trace changes back to commits and pull requests.

                Continuously deliver infrastructure through existing pipelines with [CI/CD integrations](/docs/iac/packages-and-automation/continuous-delivery/).

                Use event-based [webhooks](/docs/pulumi-cloud/webhooks/) to notify external services like Slack or continuous integration tools.

                Use [the Service API](/blog/pulumi-rest-api/) to manage stacks, updates, teams, and more.

              more_info: |
                Access, share, and manage confidential information such as secrets, passwords, and API keys as well as configuration information such as network settings and deployment options.

                Environments support importing one into another, allowing for easy composability and inheritance of shared secrets and configuration.

                Every change to an environment as well as any of its secrets and configuration is versioned, so rolling back or accessing an old version is easy.

            - title: Trust (and prove) your secrets are secure
              description: |
                 Every environment can be locked down with role-based access controls (RBAC) and versioned with all changes fully logged for auditing.

              more_info: |
                Pulumi ESC leverages the same Pulumi Cloud identity, RBAC, Teams, SAML/SCIM, OIDC, and scoped access tokens used for Pulumi IaC to ensure secrets management complies with enterprise security policies.

                Every time secrets or configuration values are accessed or changed with Pulumi ESC, the action is fully logged for auditing. Logs include who accessed what, the action they took, and even a full record of showing which originating environments accessed values are inherited from.

            - title: Ditch .env files
              description: |
                No more storing secrets in plaintext on dev computers. Developers can easily access secrets via CLI, API, Kubernetes operator, the Pulumi Cloud UI, and in-code with Typescript/Javascript, Python, and Go SDKs.

              more_info: |
                Pulumi ESC also provides just-in-time, short-lived credentials, making them easy to adopt as a security best practice.

            - title: Use with or without Pulumi IaC
              description: |
                Use Pulumi ESC to centrally manage your configuration and secrets independently of Pulumi IaC, or use ESC and IaC together for the convenience of storing secrets in config with a higher degree of security than using plaintext.
