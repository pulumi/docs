overview:
    title: Open Source IaC + Managed Platform = Success at Scale
    description: |
        **Pulumi IaC** is our open source engine that lets you write infrastructure as code in any programming language. It's free forever and works with any state backend (local files, S3, Azure Blob, etc.).
        
        **Pulumi Cloud** is the easiest way to use Pulumi in a team. It provides managed state storage, secrets encryption, team collaboration, policy enforcement, and enterprise features. Free for individuals, with team plans starting at $1 per resource.
        
        Think of it like Git (open source) vs GitHub (managed service) - you can use Git alone, but GitHub makes collaboration much easier.
