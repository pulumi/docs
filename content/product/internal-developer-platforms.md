  title: Why Pulumi IDP?
  description: Pulumi IDP eliminates the trade-off between building a custom internal developer platform and adopting a rigid off-the-shelf solution. Platform engineering teams define reusable best practices and guardrails, while developers gain flexible, self-service access to production-ready cloud infrastructure that meets enterprise standards out of the box.
