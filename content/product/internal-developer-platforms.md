  items:
    - header: "Create golden paths with components and templates"
      subheader: "Platform engineers define infrastructure patterns once, engineers use them everywhere:"
      body:
        - "**Components**: Reusable infrastructure building blocks in any language. Package your well-architected patterns."
        - "**Templates**: Scaffold entire projects with one command. Applications, microservices, clusters – all standardized."
        - "**Policies**: Enforce security and compliance automatically. Block non-compliant infrastructure before it ships."
      graphic: /images/product/idp-services-home.jpg
    - header: Self-service infrastructure, multiple interfaces
      subheader: "Engineers provision infrastructure using their preferred approach:"
      body:
        - "**Code**: Write infrastructure in TypeScript, Python, Go, .NET, or Java. Full programming power."
        - "**Low-Code**: Simple YAML for standard patterns. Platform teams create the templates, engineers fill in the values."
        - "**No-Code**: Deploy through Pulumi's project wizard or integrate with Backstage. Click to provision."
        - "**REST API**: Programmatic access for custom tools and workflows. Build your own interfaces."
      graphic: /images/product/idp-flexible-interfaces.png
    - header: Built for Day 2 operations
      subheader: Platform engineering doesn't stop at provisioning. Handle the full infrastructure lifecycle.
      body:
        - "**Drift Detection**: Know when infrastructure diverges from code. Fix drift automatically or alert the team."
        - "**Import Existing Resources**: Bring unmanaged infrastructure under control. Generate code from existing resources."
        - "**Dependency Management**: Track component usage across teams. Safely deprecate old versions."
        - "**Enterprise RBAC**: Fine-grained permissions, SAML/SSO, audit logs. Control who can change what."
