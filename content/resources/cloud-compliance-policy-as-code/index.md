    description: |
       As organizations scale their cloud infrastructure, maintaining security and compliance becomes increasingly complex. This workshop explores how Policy as Code (PaC) transforms traditional manual compliance processes into automated, version-controlled, and programmatically enforced guardrails
       
       Participants will learn how to implement effective cloud governance strategies using modern PaC approaches, including writing custom policies, integrating them into CI/CD pipelines, and establishing automated enforcement mechanisms. Through practical demonstrations using Pulumi's CrossGuard, you'll discover how to bridge the gap between security requirements and infrastructure deployment while maintaining development velocity.
       
       Whether you're dealing with cost management, security compliance, or architectural standards, you'll leave with actionable insights to implement PaC in your organization.

    learn:
        - How to transform compliance requirements into programmatic rules that can be version-controlled and automatically enforced
        - How to integrate policy enforcement into developer workflows and CI/CD pipelines to catch violations early in the development lifecycle and ensure your cloud environments stay in compliance
        - How to manage evolving security and compliance requirements against infrastructure at scale
