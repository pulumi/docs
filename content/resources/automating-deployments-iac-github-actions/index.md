    description: |
       For organizations already using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), the next crucial step is establishing reliable, secure deployment pipelines. This workshop bridges the gap between basic IaC adoption and production-grade infrastructure automation.
       
       You'll learn how to transform manual or partially automated infrastructure processes into fully automated, secure delivery pipelines. Through hands-on demos using Pulumi and GitHub Actions, you will learn how to implement enterprise-grade practices including repeatable deployments of infrastructure pipelines, automated drift detection, and secure credential handling. Discover how to overcome common challenges in infrastructure automation while building deployment workflows that enhance security, improve reliability, and reduce operational overhead.
       
       This workshop is ideal for teams looking to mature their IaC practices and establish repeatable, secure infrastructure delivery processes.

    learn:
        - Best practices for automating infrastructure delivery with IaC
        - How to create technically sound, secure IaC pipelines that reduce secret sprawl and improve your organization's security posture
        - How to enable drift detection for your infrastructure to ensure that your cloud resources stay auto
