    description: |
        One of the most popular ways to train and serve models is to do AI/ML on Kubernetes. However, data scientists typically don't do double duty as platform managers. Standing up a Kubernetes environment can be a challenge for data scientists but most data scientists know Python. We will demonstrate how with Pulumi you can deploy a machine learning platform on GKE and leverage the power of GPUs and TPUs

    learn:
        - How to deploy a machine learning platform on GKE using Pulumi, eliminating the challenges of Kubernetes management.
        - How to harness the computational power of GPUs and TPUs seamlessly within your AI/ML workflows.
