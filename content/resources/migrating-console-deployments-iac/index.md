    description: |
       As organizations scale their cloud operations, managing infrastructure through manual console deployments becomes increasingly risky and time-consuming. This workshop bridges the gap between click-ops and modern infrastructure automation, providing both technical guidance and business context for adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
       
       Participants will learn how platform engineering practices can accelerate delivery while improving reliability and security. Through hands-on demonstrations using Pulumi, attendees will discover practical strategies for transitioning existing console-created resources to code, establishing repeatable deployment patterns, and building a foundation for scalable infrastructure management. The session combines technical demonstrations with real-world business cases, making it valuable for both technical practitioners and decision-makers looking to modernize their infrastructure practices.

    learn:
        - The benefits of adopting platform engineering as a practice
        - How to start your platform engineering by adopting infrastructure as code
        - How to take resources created manually in the console and bring them under IaC automation
