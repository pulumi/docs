    description: |
        In this hands-on workshop, the Pulumi team will show you how to stand up basic services using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through a series of hands-on labs. The techniques work for any cloud --- Azure, AWS, and GCP. You’ll be able to leverage your favorite languages including Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C# instead of YAML or domain-specific languages.

        After completion of this webinar, you’ll be up and running with IaC fundamentals, modern application architectures across many clouds, and best-practices that are ready for production environments. You’ll also be ready to empower your development teams to be more productive --- continuously deploying both their applications and infrastructure.
