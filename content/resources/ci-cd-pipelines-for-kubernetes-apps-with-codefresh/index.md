    description: |
        Traditionally organizations had completely different methods of deploying
        infrastructure and applications. Teams had to learn completely different tools
        as the lifecycle of an application vs the instrustructure it is hosted on have
        different requirements and limitations.

        GitOps is a set of best practices that redefines the way changes are applied and can be used
        for both infrastructure and applications. Contrary to popular belief GitOps is not constrained
        on Kubernetes applications and simply adopting infrastructure as code is not automatically GitOps.
        In this webinar we will see how you can apply GitOps to both infrastructure (even for non-kubernetes
        environments) and applications using a unified workflow is equally attractive to operators and developers.

    learn:
        - How to apply GitOps to both Infrastructure and Applications
        - Infrastructure as code for Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes deployments
        - How to set up a unified workflow for both operators and app developers.
