            Pulumi enables our teams to deploy, scale and manage Kubernetes clusters in a fraction of the time that it took them previously, by giving them the ability to work with the languages they already know, bypassing YAML and unwieldy DSLs. It helps bring together application and infrastructure developers by eliminating silos and reducing friction in their workflows and interactions. We're excited that Pulumi Crosswalk for Kubernetes will simplify our infrastructure provisioning even further, advancing application lifecycle management throughout our organization.
