        Terraform uses a proprietary DSL called HCL to describe and provision infrastructure resources.

        In Pulumi, you describe infrastructure using familiar languages and tools, providing productivity gains,
        better abstraction and reuse, and developer approachability — while still supporting robust infrastructure
        as code provisioning across many clouds.

        I needed a solution that cut across silos and gave our developers a tool they could use
        themselves to provision infrastructure to suit their own immediate needs. The way Pulumi
        solves the multi-cloud problem is exactly what I was looking for.

        As the largest eCommerce platform in Latin America, our infrastructure has to be highly
        stable, well documented and agile. With Pulumi, we're able to develop new infrastructure,
        change existing infrastructure and more with greater speed and reliability than we've ever
        had before.

        We are building a distributed-database-as-a-service product that runs on Kubernetes clusters
        across multiple public clouds including GCP, AWS and others. Pulumi's declarative model,
        the support for real programming languages, and the uniform workflow on any cloud
        make our SRE team much more efficient.

        Sourcegraph uses Kubernetes heavily and Pulumi is a great tool that lets us work efficiently
        with Kubernetes and support a rich set of configuration options for our customers' diverse
        set of scaling, deployment, and end-user needs. Pulumi's infrastructure as code model makes
        working on this stuff a joy.

        Our team was looking for an end-to-end solution to tame the complexity of Kubernetes on AWS
        and ensure we adhere to AWS best practices. Pulumi has equipped our team to scale far better:
        our delivery is now automated and we can now deliver new features with much faster turn-around.
        Pulumi is key to our team's productivity.
