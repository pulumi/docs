# mktutorial

This tool takes the [Pulumi examples repo](https://github.com/pulumi/examples) and
generates tutorials for this website out of them. The tool generally prefers that those tutorials follow the
[standard format](https://github.com/pulumi/examples/blob/master/example-readme-template.md.txt),
however is fairly resilient provided the tutorials have `README.md` files that are authored in
legal Markdown.
