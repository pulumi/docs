## Pulumi.yaml {#pulumi-yaml}

### Project name {#project-name}
The property `name` is used to identify a project. If the name is changed through `Pulumi.yaml`, the association between stack and project will be lost. 

TODO: is there `pulumi project rename`?

TODO: explain that the name defined in `package.json` is NOT used at all by Pulumi.
