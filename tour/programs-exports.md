title: Stack exports
---

It can be handy to export values from your stacks.

Exporting a value simply records its final value anytime you perform a deployment.  These values are typically output
properties from resources, but they can be anything.

For instance, the following code creates a VM and exports its auto-assigned public IP address:

{% include langchoose.html %}

```javascript
var aws = require("@pulumi/aws");
var server = new aws.ec2.Instance("my-vm", {
    ami: "ami-7172b611",
    instanceType: "t2.micro",
});
exports.ipAddress = server.publicIp;
```

```typescript
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
let aws = require("@pulumi/aws");
let server = new aws.ec2.Instance("my-vm", {
    ami: "ami-7172b611",
    instanceType: "t2.micro",
});
export let ipAddress = server.publicIp;
```

```python
import pulumi
from pulumi_aws import ec2
server = ec2.Instance('my-vm',
    ami='ami-7172b611',
    instance_type='t2.micro')
pulumi.export('ipAddress', server.public_ip)
```

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws/sdk/go/aws/ec2"
    "github.com/pulumi/pulumi/sdk/go/pulumi"
)

func main() {
    pulumi.Run(func (ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
        server, err := ec2.NewInstancectx, "my-vm", &ec2.InstanceArgs{
            Ami:          "ami-7172b611",
            InstanceType: "t2.micro",
        })
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        pulumi.Export("ipAddress", server.PublicIp)
        return nil
    })
}
```

After deploying this program with `pulumi up`, the exports will be printed, including any diffs.

And the `pulumi stack output` command may be used to retrieve all of them:

```bash
$ pulumi stack output
Current stack outputs (1):
    OUTPUT                  VALUE
    ipAddress               34.215.221.228
```

Or even a specific value:

```bash
$ pulumi stack output ipAddress
34.215.221.228
```

This command was designed to make scripting against the `pulumi` CLI easy, for instance if you need to plug that IP
address into another command as part of your automation, like `curl`ing or `ssh`ing into it.
