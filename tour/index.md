Welcome to a tour of Pulumi.

This tour's goal is to teach you what Pulumi does and how it does it.  There are many examples that are meant to
be starting points for your own experimentation.

Make sure you've installed [the CLI](/reference/cli), and then you'll be ready to go:

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com/ | sh
```

Look for the arrows at the bottom of the page, or left-hand navigation, to advance to the next topic.

> Most commands will prompt you to login to [the Pulumi service](https://app.pulumi.com/) when you run them.  The CLI
> works in tandem with the service to deliver a reliable experience, including within a team setting. You may
> [login](/reference/cli/pulumi_login.html) and [logout](/reference/cli/pulumi_logout.html) explicitly if you prefer.
