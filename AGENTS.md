# AGENTS.md — Canonical Instructions for This Repository

This file defines guidance for AI agents like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot when working in this repository. All automated or manual contributions must comply with these rules.

---

## Repository context

This repository contains the source for the Pulumi website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It includes documentation, blog posts, marketing material, and example programs.

---

## Build / Test / Lint Workflow

Agents must use these exact commands:

- Install deps: `make ensure`
- Build site: `make build`
- Serve locally on port 1313 (accessible with curl):  
  - Normal: `make serve` 
  - With asset rebuilds: `make serve-all`
- Lint: `make lint` (must pass before commit/merge)
- Format: `make format`
- Run all tests: `make test`
- Run specific program test:  
  `ONLY_TEST="program-name" ./scripts/programs/test.sh`
- Fix trailing spaces:  
  `sed -i '' 's/[[:space:]]*$//' file1.md file2.md ...`

Do not substitute other tools or commands.

---

## Style Authority

1. Always follow `STYLE-GUIDE.md`.  
2. If a rule is not covered there, fall back to the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style).  
3. Do not invent new style conventions. Ask for clarification if something is ambiguous.

---

## Absolute Prohibitions

- **Package manager**: Do **not** change `package.json` to use pnpm. Yarn/npm only.  
- **New files**: Must always end with a newline.  
- **Internal links**: Never use raw Markdown links for docs. Always use Hugo’s `relref` shortcode. (This applies only to agents. Humans may use markdown links as described in STYLE-GUIDE.md.)

---

## Code & Content Rules

- **Markdown**: Semantic line breaks (one line per sentence/phrase).  
- **Headings**:  
  - H1 = Title Case  
  - H2+ = Sentence case
- **Code Examples**: Place in `/static/programs` with language suffix in filename.  
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Must follow `tsconfig.json` settings. No comments unless explicitly requested.  
- **File Placement**:  
  - Docs go under `content/docs/...`
  - Blog posts go under `content/blog/...`
  - Other content goes into appropriate `content/...` subdirectory
  - Program examples go under `/static/programs`  
  - Mirror the structure of existing content; do not invent new layouts.
- **Includes**: Use Hugo shortcodes for shared content, never raw Markdown copy-paste.  
- **Naming**: Use lowercase for non-proper nouns (e.g. “stack,” not “Stack”).  
- **Ordered Lists**: Every item begins with `1.` to minimize diff noise.
- **Spelling/Grammar**: Always correct errors. Use American English spelling.

## Enforcement

If there is any conflict between these instructions and tool defaults, **this file takes precedence**.  
Do not improvise, "improve," or override these rules.
