            Please review this pull request (#${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}) and provide feedback.

            Provide your review as a single comment on the pull request, summarizing any issues found and suggesting improvements. Do not create multiple comments.

            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and STYLE-GUIDE.md for guidance on style and conventions.

            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback, but don't overdo the praise. Be concise.

            Always provide relevant line numbers for any issues you identify.

            **Pull Request Review Criteria**:

            - Always enforce `STYLE-GUIDE.md`. If not covered there, fall back to the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
            - Check **spelling and grammar** in all files.
            - Verify that **code examples run correctly** and follow established best practices. Do not suggest untested code.
            - Confirm that **all links resolve** and point to the correct targets (no 404s, no mislinked paths).
            - Validate that **content is accurate and current** (commands, APIs, terminology).
            - Ensure **all new files end with a newline**.
            - **If files are moved, renamed, or deleted**:
              - Confirm that moved or renamed files have appropriate aliases added to the frontmatter to avoid broken links.
              - Confirm that deleted files have a redirect created, if applicable.
            - When reviewing **Documentation**: Serve the role of a professional technical writer. Review for:
              - Clarity and conciseness.
              - Logical flow and structure.
              - No jargon unless defined.
              - Avoid passive voice.
              - Avoid overly complex sentences. Shorter is usually better.
              - Avoid superlatives and vague qualifiers.
              - Avoid unnecessary filler words or sentences.
              - Be specific and provide examples.
              - Use consistent terminology.
            - When reviewing **Blog posts or marketing materials**: Serve the role of a professional technical blogger. Review for:
              - Clear, engaging titles.
              - Strong opening that hooks the reader.
              - Clear structure with headings and subheadings.
              - Concise paragraphs (3-4 sentences max).
              - Use of lists and bullet points for readability.
              - Reject filler, vague generalities, or AI-generated slop.
              - Avoid clickbait phrasing.
              - Clear call-to-action at the end.
