The $CLOUD $ARCHITECTURE template creates an infrastructure as code project
in your favorite language that deploys a $THING to $CLOUD with Pulumi.
It uses this resource, this other resource, and probably some other awesome resource
to accomplish some particular desirable outcome.
The template generates a complete Pulumi program, including $INCLUDED_STUFF,
to give you a working project out of the box that you can customize easily
and extend to suit your needs.

## Using this template

To use this template to deploy your own $THING,
make sure you've [installed Pulumi](/docs/install/)
and [configured your $CLOUD credentials](/registry/packages/$CLOUD/installation-configuration/#credentials),
then create a new [project](/docs/concepts/projects/) using the template in your language of choice:

{{< templates/pulumi-new >}}

Follow the prompts to complete the new-project wizard.
When it's done, you'll have a complete Pulumi project
that's ready to deploy and configured with the most common settings.
Feel free to inspect the code in {{< langfile >}} for a closer look.

## Deploying the project

The template requires no additional configuration.
Once the new project is created,
you can deploy it immediately with [`pulumi up`](/docs/cli/commands/pulumi_up/):

```bash
$ pulumi up
```

When the deployment completes,
Pulumi exports the following [stack output](/docs/concepts/stack/#outputs) values:

someOutput
: The provider-assigned property of the widget resource.

someOtherOutput
: The fully-qualified HTTP URL of the widget resource.

Output values like these are useful in many ways,
most commonly as inputs for other stacks or related cloud resources.
The computed `someOutput`, for example, can be used from the command line
to open the newly deployed website in your favorite web browser:

```bash
$ open $(pulumi stack output cdnURL)
```

## Customizing the project

Projects created with the $ARCHITECTURE template expose
the following [configuration](/docs/concepts/config/) settings:

someProp
: The description of the property. Defaults to `someValue`.

otherProp
: The file to use for top-level pages. Defaults to `otherValue`.

All of these settings are optional and may be adjusted
either by editing the stack configuration file directly (by default, `Pulumi.dev.yaml`)
or by changing their values with [`pulumi config set`](/docs/cli/commands/pulumi_config_set/) as shown below.

### Changing a config value

If you already have a $THING you'd like to deploy on $CLOUD with Pulumi,
you can do so either by replacing placeholder content in the `foo` folder
or by configuring the stack to point to another folder on your computer with the `someProp` setting:

```bash
$ pulumi config set someProp ../some/value
$ pulumi up
```

### Adjusting the code somehow

By default, the generated program configures some resource in a particular way,
which may or may not be the best fit for your project.
You can adjust these settings by changing the code in {{< langfile >}}:

{{% chooser language "typescript,python,go,csharp,yaml" / %}}

{{% choosable %}}

```diff
const cdn = new aws.cloudfront.Distribution("cdn", {
    defaultCacheBehavior: {
-       minTtl: 600,
+       minTtl: 3600,
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language python %}}

```diff
cdn = aws.cloudfront.Distribution(
    default_cache_behavior=aws.cloudfront.DistributionDefaultCacheBehaviorArgs(
-       min_ttl=600,
+       min_ttl=3600,
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language go %}}

```diff
cdn, err := cloudfront.NewDistribution(ctx, "cdn", &cloudfront.DistributionArgs{
    DefaultCacheBehavior: &cloudfront.DistributionDefaultCacheBehaviorArgs{
-       MinTtl:     pulumi.Int(600),
+       MinTtl:     pulumi.Int(3600),
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language csharp %}}

```diff
var cdn = new Aws.CloudFront.Distribution("cdn", new()
{
    DefaultCacheBehavior = new Aws.CloudFront.Inputs.DistributionDefaultCacheBehaviorArgs
    {
-       MinTtl = 600,
+       MinTtl = 3600,
```

{{% /choosable %}}

{{% choosable language yaml %}}

```diff
cdn:
  type: aws:cloudfront:Distribution
  properties:
    defaultCacheBehavior:
-     minTtl: 600
+     minTtl: 600
```

{{% /choosable %}}

Alternatively, you could make these settings configurable as well,
which would allow them to vary between other stacks in your project.

## Tidying up

You can cleanly destroy the stack and all of its infrastructure with [`pulumi destroy`](docs/cli/commands/pulumi_destroy/):

```bash
$ pulumi destroy
```
