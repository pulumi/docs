## SEO Checklist

- [ ] Identify whether the intent of the piece is informational, preferential, navigational, or transactional
- [ ] Select one primary keyword (high-volume, relevant) and several semantically-relevant secondary keywords (long-tail)
- [ ] Note whether the primary and secondary keyword searches trigger AI summaries, FAQs, or carousels in SERPs
- [ ] Note if top resulting content types are videos, listicles, etc and what makes it engaging (headings, visuals, depth, etc)
- [ ] Identify gaps that can be filled among the top performing results (new data, better examples, etc)
- [ ] Only use a single H1 with the primary keyword intact; it should be unique to the entire website
- [ ] Use descriptive H2s and H3s along with the secondary keywords for logical flow
- [ ] Break up long text into paragraphs (<5 sentences)
- [ ] Use bullet points and numbered lists where applicable
- [ ] Include a concise summary that states the intent by addressing the readers needs
- [ ] Make sure the content is [H.E.E.A.T.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OvdLR_25BXrAvozYt5XzMNGBVuy9a_NL4gsnEz1_uZA/edit#slide=id.g3164f0b88d5_0_30) (Helpful, Expertly-guided, Experienced, Authoritative, Trustworthy)

- [ ] Run page through [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console?resource_id=sc-domain%3Apulumi.com) to submit / verify that it has been indexed
