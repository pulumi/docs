## SEO Checklist

- [ ] Identify whether the intent of the piece is informational, preferential, navigational, or transactional

- [ ] Identify gaps that can be filled among the top performing results (new data, better examples, etc)
- [ ] Only use a single H1 with the primary keyword intact; it should be unique to the entire website
- [ ] Use descriptive H2s and H3s along with the secondary keywords for logical flow
