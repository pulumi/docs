# This script uses the list-recent-buckets script to find buckets that can be safely
# deleted, then deletes them. See that script for details, but in general, a bucket is
# deletable if and only if:
#
# * It's not currently serving the website AND some number of buckets behind the one
#   currently serving the website, or
# * It's associated with a PR that's been closed.
