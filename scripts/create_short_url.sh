# Create shortened URL targets (shortlinks) for links on the doc site.
#
# Shortlink definitions are created as markdown files in the /content/shortlinks directory.
# Each of these files contains a reference to the target link, and the desired
# shortlink that will redirect to the target. In the common case, the shortlink
# is a randomly generated string, but a specific shortlink can also be specified.
# Note that the shortlink must include a trailing / for the redirection to work correctly.
