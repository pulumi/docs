# This file contains programs that should be ignored by the example code test script.

# This also supports grep compatible regex patterns so we can ignore all programs that match
# a given pattern. You can also include comments in the file to explain why the program is being ignored.

# No need to include a leading anchor (^) or trailing EOL ($) as these are handled by the script to support
# matching directories listed specifically.

# Example:
# aws-.* will ignore all programs that start with "aws-"
#


# Java examples of LoadBalancedFargateService erroneously complain about missing container declarations.
