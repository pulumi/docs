# This script takes the built Hugo site and:
#   - creates a new S3 bucket named according to whether the action is a push or pull_request.
#   - creates a list of all Hugo-generated client-side ("meta-refresh") redirects that
#   - we'll use to produce proper 301s later.
#   - pushes the content of the website into the new S3 bucket.
#   - tests the built website, first for broken links, then with Cypress to ensure pages
#   - render and behave properly.
#   - emits a metadata file containing information about the commit and bucket, which
#   - Pulumi will use to process its update.
#   - writes a record to AWS Parameter Store relating the generated bucket to the commit
#   - responsible for producing it.
#   - Posts a PR comment back to GitHub, if applicable.
