# This script lists the 100 most recent S3 buckets populated from preview build jobs. It
# works by querying S3 for buckets with names matching our bucket naming prefix,
# then fetches the metadata files we generate with each build, outputting their results.
#
# For buckets built by `pull_request` and `push` jobs, the script will also tell you
# whether a given bucket can be safely deleted.
#
# Usage:
#
#   # List all buckets
#   ./scripts/ci/list-buckets.sh
#
#   # List all buckets prefixed with "-pr-" (to filter pull_request builds)
#   ./scripts/ci/list-buckets.sh pr
#
#   # List all buckets prefixed with "-push-" (to filter push builds)
#   ./scripts/ci/list-buckets.sh push
#
#   # List only the buckets that can be safely deleted
#   ./scripts/ci/list-buckets.sh [push | pr] --only-deletables
