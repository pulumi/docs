# UX Standards

These standards include some basic user experience guidelines we align to on the marketing website, docs, and the registry.

- Every page should have no more than one primary action.
- Use descriptive text for button labels and links, and avoid labels such as "Learn more."
- Use unique labels for distinct actions i.e., having two buttons with the same label that take different actions is confusing to users.
- Use existing components, or improve existing components over creating new components unless you identify a need that is not solveable with the current components.
- Use line lengths between 45 â€“ 75 characters (this is in reference to the rendered page, not the markdown).
- Links should take you to another page, and buttons should take an action on the page.
- When possible, links should look like links, and buttons should look like buttons.
- When not a special case (e.g., navigation), links should exist within the context of text.
