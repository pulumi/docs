# The date represents the post's publish date, and by default corresponds with
# the date and time this file was generated. Dates are used for display and
# ordering purposes only; they have no effect on whether or when a post is
# published. To influence the ordering of posts published on the same date, use
# the time portion of the date value; posts are sorted in descending order by
# date/time.
date: {{ .Date }}

# The draft setting determines whether a post is published. Set it to true if
# you want to be able to merge the post without publishing it.
draft: false

# Use the meta_desc property to provide a brief summary (one or two sentences)
# of the content of the post, which is useful for targeting search results or
# social-media previews. This field is required or the build will fail the
# linter test. Max length is 160 characters.
meta_desc:

# The meta_image appears in social-media previews and on the blog home page. A
# placeholder image representing the recommended format, dimensions and aspect
# ratio has been provided for you.
meta_image: meta.png

# At least one author is required. The values in this list correspond with the
# `id` properties of the team member files at /data/team/team. Create a file for
# yourself if you don't already have one.
authors:
    - joe-duffy

# At least one tag is required. Lowercase, hyphen-delimited is recommended.

What you put here will appear on the index page. In most cases, you'll also want to add a Read More link after this paragraph (though technically, that's optional. To do that, just add an HTML comment like the one below.

<!--more-->

And then everything _after_ that comment will appear on the post page itself.

Either way, avoid using images or code samples [in the first 70 words](https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/#automatic-summary-splitting) of your post, as these may not render properly in summary contexts (e.g., on the blog home page or in social-media previews).

## Writing the Post

For help assembling the content of your post, see [BLOGGING.md](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-hugo/blob/master/BLOGGING.md). For general formatting guidelines, see the [Style Guide](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-hugo/blob/master/STYLE-GUIDE.md).

## Code Samples

```typescript
let bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("stuff");
...
```

## Images

![Placeholder Image](meta.png)

## Videos

{{< youtube "kDB-YRKFfYE?rel=0" >}}

Note the `?rel=0` param, which tells YouTube to suggest only videos from same channel.
