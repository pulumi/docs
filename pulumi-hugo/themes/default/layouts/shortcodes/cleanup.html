<p>Before moving on, tear down the resources that are part of your stack to avoid incurring any charges.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Run {{ "`pulumi destroy`" | markdownify }} to tear down all resources. You'll be prompted to make sure you really want to delete these resources. A destroy operation may
        take some time, since Pulumi waits for the resources to finish shutting down before it considers the destroy operation to be complete.
    </li>
    <li>To delete the stack itself, run {{ "`pulumi stack rm`" | markdownify }}. Note that this command deletes all deployment history from the Pulumi Service.</li>
</ol>
