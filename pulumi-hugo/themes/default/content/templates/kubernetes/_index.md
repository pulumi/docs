### What is Kubernetes?

[Kubernetes (k8s)](/kubernetes) is an open source container management and orchestration project. It enables infrastructure engineers and platform teams to deploy and run container services at scale with a control plane that schedules, deploys, and scales containers throughout their lifecycle using a desired state model. The benefits of using k8s include its portability across multiple environments and clouds, high scalability, and extensibility via an ecosystem of extensions and plugins.

**On [AWS](/aws/),** you can use Kubernetes with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

**On [Azure](/azure/),** you can use Kubernetes with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

**On [Google Cloud Platform](/gcp/),** you can use Kubernetes with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

### Building and deploying Kubernetes clusters on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud

[Infrastructure as code](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/) is an efficient and repeatable way of building Kubernetes clusters and their infrastructure with programming languages and deploying them to your preferred cloud.

Pulumiâ€™s open source, infrastructure as code SDK lets you build and deploy Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure with TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, .NET, and YAML. The main benefits include:

* **Programming Languages:** Define infrastructure as code in your favorite language instead of domain-specific languages or clicking through cloud consoles.

* **Cloud Native Ecosystem Support:** Use Helm charts and native Kubernetes API objects, including integrated Kustomize support, to deploy workloads to your Kubernetes cluster.

* **Fast, Easy Deployment:** Quickly deploy your Kubernetes cluster and associated infrastructure with the CLI, with a [GitOps workflow](/docs/using-pulumi/continuous-delivery/pulumi-kubernetes-operator/), or from a CI/CD workflow.

* **Rapid Development:** Author, version, test, and release cluster and infrastructure changes just like software.
