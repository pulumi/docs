    Whether you're new to Microsoft Azure or already using it to manage your infrastructure, Pulumi makes getting started easy. If you're just starting out, you can write your infrastructure code using the Pulumi Azure SDK. Or if you're already managing resources with Azure, you can deploy an existing ARM template using Pulumi or you can rewrite the ARM template JSON in a programming language, either entirely, or one resource at a time.

    If you can deploy a resource with ARM templates, you can deploy it with the Pulumi Azure provider!
