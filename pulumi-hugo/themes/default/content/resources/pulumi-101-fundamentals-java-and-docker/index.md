    Learn the basics of Pulumi from projects to components. We’ll use
    Java and Docker to build, configure, and deploy a real-life, modern
    application with related infrastructure: a system that runs the fictitious
    Pulumipus Boba Tea Shop. Along the way, we’ll learn how infrastructure as
    code makes updates easier, reduces time to value, and helps you keep your
    cloud costs down.
    
    If you want to code along, you’ll need a [free Pulumi
    SaaS account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/), [the Pulumi
    CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/), and
    [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running on your
    machine.
