        Getting started with Kubernetes doesn't have to be complex! Pulumi's infrastructure-as-code (IaC) platform can help remove the complexity and enable even beginner developers to use any programming language to provision modern infrastructure. In this session, you will learn the fundamentals of building and deploying containerized workloads and get an introduction to Pulumi's IaC platform and deployment on Azure.

        Weâ€™ll guide you through setting up an Azure AKS cluster and deploying a containerized workload to the cluster. This workshop is designed to help new users become familiar with the core concepts needed to effectively deploy Kubernetes clusters and workloads on Azure. We will guide you through the Pulumi platform with diagrams and a series of examples to help accelerate your cloud projects.
