  description: >-
    Want to learn how to use the only [Infrastructure as Code](/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/) (IaC) tool that
    supports 100% of Azure capabilities?


    In this workshop, the Pulumi team will show you how to define, deploy and manage Azure resources using Infrastructure as Code through a series of hands-on labs. The techniques work for any cloud -- Azure, AWS, and GCP. You'll be able to leverage your favorite languages including Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C# instead of YAML or domain-specific languages.


    After completing this workshop, you'll be up and running with IaC fundamentals, modern application architectures across many clouds, and best-practices that are ready for production environments. You'll also be ready to empower your development teams to be more productive -- continuously deploying both their applications and infrastructure.
