      When platform teams are planning Cloud Native platforms for their application developers, they often need to decide how to manage persistent storage: either as a MongoDB workload running inside their Kubernetes cluster or as a managed service outside of the cluster.

      In this session, we’ll show you how to set up a platform that includes Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with scalable persistent storage provided by Azure Cosmos DB with its API support for MongoDB – and we’ll do it all using Python and Pulumi.

    learn:
        - Deploy and manage k8s clusters
        - Deploy and manage Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB support
        - Deploy and manage K8s services
