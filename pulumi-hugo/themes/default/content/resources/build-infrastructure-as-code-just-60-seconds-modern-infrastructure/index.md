Just go to Pulumi dot com slash A I and then choose your language. You'll see instructions on the sidebar to help you get started with Pulumi. If you haven't already set it up. Of course, the real magic is in the prompt box. Simply type in what you're looking to do. Be it, create a basic instance. I can connect to remotely, make a database cluster or even stand up a Cobert cluster with multiple auto scaling node groups, click generate and then watch the code get written for you. Bloomy A I will create all the necessary parts from an instance itself to security groups that will allow access pro tip preface your questions with. Please let's keep things with the A I friendly copy out the generated code once it's done and paste it into your editor of choice.
