        With @PulumiCorp I said goodbye to #YAML and JSON supersets. I went back to what I love: #code. Code. End to end. Functional, even. #Kubernetes is pleasant again.

        I just spent a few hours getting used to @PulumiCorp SDK and I am already asking myself why I ever used #Terraform 😂  Real Infrastructure as Code all the way 💪 😍

        Just Pulumi-ified a ton of random AWS resources & it feels so good.

        I've been playing around with Pulumi a bit and I have to say this is really quite well done. The documentation is very polished and all tutorials I tried worked exactly copy paste out of the box.

        Congratulations Joe. Loved the idea of pulumi since I did a talk with one of the first releases. I genuinely think this model is the future inside DevOps and out

        Really liking Pulumi's .NET binary  support. Don't have to copy source code around environment pipelines and don't have to deal with runtime/sdk/re-compilation nonsense on deployment hosts / agents. Just native exe's ftw.
