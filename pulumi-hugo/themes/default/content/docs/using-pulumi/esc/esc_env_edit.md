Edit an environment definition

## Synopsis

Edit an environment definition

This command fetches the current definition for the named environment and opens it
for editing in an editor. The editor defaults to the value of the VISUAL environment
variable. If VISUAL is not set, EDITOR is used. These values are interpreted as
commands to which the name of the temporary file used for the environment is appended.
If no editor is specified via the --editor flag or environment variables, edit
defaults to `vi`.


```
esc env edit [<org-name>/]<environment-name> [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --editor string   the command to use to edit the environment definition
  -h, --help            help for edit
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --env string   The name of the environment to operate on.
```
