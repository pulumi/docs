## Overview

In Pulumi ESC, an environment is a collection of configuration intended to capture the configuration values needed to work with a particular environment.

An environment can be created one of two ways:

- via the Pulumi Cloud console
- via the CLI

This tutorial will walk you through how to create a new environment.

## Create an environment

### Create via the console

To create an environment via the console, navigate to [Pulumi Cloud](https://app.pulumi.com) and select the **Environments** link in the left-hand menu.

You will be directed to the Environments landing page. To create a new environment, click the **Create Environment** button. Enter a name for your environment (e.g., `my-dev-environment` for a development environment) and then click **Create Environment**. You will then be directed to the environment definition page.

### Create via the CLI

To create an environment via the CLI, use the `esc env init` command as shown below, where `<org-name>` is optional and defaults to your Pulumi Cloud username.

```bash
esc env init [<org-name>/]<environment-name>
```

Note that environment names must be unique within an organization and may only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and periods.

```bash
$ esc env init my-dev-environment
Environment created.
```

You can validate that your environment was created by running the `esc env ls` command which will list all of the environments that you have access to.

```bash
$ esc env ls
myorg/test
```

In the next section, you will learn how to store configuration values and secrets in your environment.
