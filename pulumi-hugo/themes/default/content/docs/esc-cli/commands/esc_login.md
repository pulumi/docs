Log in to the Pulumi Cloud

## Synopsis

Log in to the Pulumi Cloud.

The Pulumi Cloud manages your Pulumi ESC environments. Simply run

    $ esc login

and this command will prompt you for an access token, including a way to launch your web browser to
easily obtain one. You can script by using `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

By default, this will log in to the managed Pulumi Cloud backend.
If you prefer to log in to a self-hosted Pulumi Cloud backend, specify a URL. For example, run

    $ pulumi login https://api.pulumi.acmecorp.com

to log in to a self-hosted Pulumi Cloud running at the api.pulumi.acmecorp.com domain.

For `https://` URLs, the CLI will speak REST to a Pulumi Cloud that manages state and concurrency control.
You can specify a default org to use when logging into the Pulumi Cloud backend or a self-hosted Pulumi Cloud.


```
esc login [<url>] [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -c, --cloud-url string     A cloud URL to log in to
      --default-org string   A default org to associate with the login.
  -h, --help                 help for login
      --insecure             Allow insecure server connections when using SSL
      --shared pulumi        Log in to the account in use by the pulumi CLI
```
