The [Pulumi Cloud](https://app.pulumi.com) can be configured to work with any SAML 2.0 identity provider. SAML support requires Pulumi Enterprise or Pulumi Business Critical. To learn more about the capabilities of Pulumi Enterprise or Pulumi Business Critical, refer to the [pricing page](/pricing/).

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

If you're a member of a SAML-based Pulumi organization, you can sign in to [your account](/docs/pulumi-cloud/accounts/) via Single Sign-On. To learn about the important aspects of configuring SSO for your IdP, refer to the [SSO page](sso/).
