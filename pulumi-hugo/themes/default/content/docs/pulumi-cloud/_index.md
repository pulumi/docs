[Pulumi Cloud](https://app.pulumi.com) is a secure cloud service for individuals and teams using Pulumi's open-source SDK and Pulumi Environments, Secrets and Configuration (ESC). It manages deployment state and secrets, enables search across your clouds, runs deployments, integrates with CI/CD, and enforces policies and access controls.

The Pulumi CLI automatically uses Pulumi Cloud unless you set up a [self-managed backend](/docs/concepts/state/#using-a-self-managed-backend).

## Getting started

In your browser, navigate to <a href="https://app.pulumi.com" target="_blank">app.pulumi.com</a> and create an account.

<a class="btn btn-secondary" href="https://app.pulumi.com/signup" target="_blank">Create an Account</a>

When you sign in to Pulumi Cloud, a personal organization is automatically
created on the **Individual** Edition. The Pulumi Individual Edition is free forever for unlimited individual use.

You can create an unlimited number of stacks, encrypt configuration and resource secrets, and browse stack history. To collaborate with other developers or use advanced features like [SAML SSO](/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/saml/), you'll need to create a Pulumi [organization](/docs/pulumi-cloud/organizations/).
