The [Pulumi Console](https://app.pulumi.com) can be configured to work with any SAML 2.0 identity provider. SAML support requires Pulumi Enterprise Edition. To learn more about the capabilities of the Enterprise Edition, refer to the [pricing page]({{< ref "/pricing" >}}).

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

If you're a member of a SAML-based Pulumi organization, you can sign in to [your account]({{< relref "/docs/intro/console/accounts-and-organizations/accounts" >}}) via Single Sign-On. To learn about the important aspects of configuring SSO for your IdP, refer to the [SSO page]({{< relref "sso" >}}).
