            CrossCode enables a polyglot world where one team can write infrastructure as code components in one language and another team can consume them from another language. CrossCode supports any JVM language (Java, Scala, Kotlin, Clojure), .NET (C#, F#, PowerShell), Node.js (JavaScript, TypeScript), Go, Python, and markup languages (YAML, JSON, CUE). CrossCode components enable the sharing and reuse of well-architected building blocks that can be consumed across the organization.

            CrossCode can translate existing infrastructure as code, such as Terraform HCL, AWS CloudFormation templates, Azure Resource Manager templates, and Kubernetes YAML, to Pulumi. This helps organizations preserve existing infrastructure as code assets but carry them forward into the future.
