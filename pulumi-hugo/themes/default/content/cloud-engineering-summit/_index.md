    - name: Build
      topics:
        - Reusable infrastructure practices
        - Docker, containers, or Kubernetes
        - Building React Native, cloud-based apps
        - Serverless apps development
        - Data science and ML apps
        - Sharing your open source project
      description: |
        Modern cloud applications and architectures blur the lines between app infrastructure and cloud engineering teams adopting new tools and practices to tame complexity and accelerate delivery. Embracing that success in the modern cloud era requires some level of proficiency in both cloud infrastructure and applications. Whether they're full-stack or specialize in one area, all cloud engineers apply a software engineering mindset and practices to building and testing applications and the underlying cloud infrastructure.

    - name: Deploy
      topics:
        - CI/CD practices
        - How to empower developers across your organization with shared services platforms or internal cloud platforms
        - Orchestrating workflows and microservices
        - Share your open source project
      description: |
        Cloud engineering teams deploy modern cloud applications and infrastructure through unified and automated delivery processes with thorough testing. Often this means deploying infrastructure and application code together through a CI/CD process that builds, tests, and deploys cloud applications. Many others build shared services platforms that automatically deploy approved infrastructure for end-users, such as developers.

    - name: Manage
      topics:
        - Security & governance
        - Observability and monitoring
        - How to manage cloud access and controls across organizations
      description: |
        Cloud engineering teams manage cloud applications and infrastructure with Policy as Code, visibility, and access controls. For example, they manage infrastructure with policies that detect configuration drift, enforce best practices, and even prevent compliance violations before deployment. They build visibility across their cloud infrastructure so that they always understand its current and past states, including detailed audit history.
