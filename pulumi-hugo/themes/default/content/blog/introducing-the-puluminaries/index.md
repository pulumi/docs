Pulumi is more than a way to build, deploy, and manage your infrastructure and cloud applications. Pulumi is also a strong and vibrant community. We are very excited to announce and showcase our new program of community champions, the Puluminaries!

The Puluminaries program was created to recognize members of the Pulumi community who are experts and leaders in the field of programming and infrastructure, but also who give back to the community to make it grow! They help others get started, give feedback to make Pulumi's roadmap even better, and educate people through content or public speaking. The program is open to all members of the community, and we welcome anyone to join the program.

While the Puluminaries themselves have been active in the community for quite some time, we officially launched the program at [PulumiUP](https://pulumi.com/pulumi-up) in 2022, and it is our pleasure to introduce the first cohort of members to the program!

## Meet The Puluminaries!

Engin's excitement for Pulumi is not possible to be measured using current science. He will always share his thoughts on new developements in the Pulumi project, as well as join in for fun and discussion in various PulumiVision livestreams!

He is ever-present in the Pulumi Community, sharing his knowledge to folks who are just getting started, but also bringing to bear his real-world expertise in complex Pulumi implementations. Chances are, if you see a great answer to a question in [Pulumi Community Slack](https://slack.pulumi.com/), it came from Paul.

Ringo also created the [Pulumi Resource Type for Concourse](https://github.com/ringods/pulumi-resource), and is ever-present in every community he is a part of, not just Pulumi's!
