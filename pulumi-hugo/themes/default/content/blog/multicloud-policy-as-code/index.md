Policies protect your infrastructure by controlling access, set limits that reduce the blast radius of an incident, and manage infrastructure operations. Policies are commonly created through a form on a cloud provider's administrative console, making replicating or versioning the policy more difficult. With Policy as Code, you can apply software engineering practices such as automated testing, deployment, and version control when creating policies.

CrossGuard is Pulumi's Policy as Code solution that lets you create, verify, apply, and enforce policies. Policies are standalone packages that can be run against any Pulumi stack. That means your policies are language agnostic and work with any language supported by Pulumi. Policy Packages are policy bundles that evaluate every resource in your stack, whether deployed in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or Kubernetes.

The key features of CrossGuard are:

- Policy SDK for coding custom policies using TypeScript/JavaScript or Python
- Validating infrastructure before deployment by verifying it locally
- Policy Packs for enforcing best practices for security, reliability, and cost
- Validating all the infrastructure deployed by an organization.

Whether you create policies for a single project or across your organization, CrossGuard enforces best practices for cost, compliance, security, and team practices.

## Parts of a policy

A policy is made up of the following parts:

- a name
- a description
- an enforcement level
- a resource validation
- a message to report the violation

![Parts of a policy](policy-parts.png)

Policies enforce a specific logic. In the example above, Kubernetes can't expose services to the Internet. We accomplish this by not allowing a `spec` to create LoadBalancer when a service is declared. Policies are checked during `pulumi preview` and during `pulumi update` to enforce defined restrictions.

There are two types of policies, a `ResourceValidationPolicy` that validates a particular resource in a stack, and a  `StackValidationPolicy` that validates the stack as a whole. When CrossGuard calls a `ResourceValidationPolicy`, it checks each resource in the stack. These checks are before a resource is created and blocks any resources that fail the policy logic.

A `StackValidationPolicy` is run against the entire stack, requiring all the resources to be created and registered. Resources that fail validation will be blocked from being created or modified during `pulumi up`. Out of compliance resources will fail during preview or update, and we recommend running `pulumi preview` to catch these resources. Stack validation policies inspect multiple resources at once. This lets you validate resources dependent on other resources, such as a database that requires persistent storage.

Now that we understand how CrossGuard works. let's look at examples for several cloud providers and Kubernetes.

## Examples

The following examples are a common scenario showing how to prevent access to data in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Kubernetes using either TypeScript or Python to create policies. You can try out any of these policies by creating a new directory and running `pulumi policy new`, e.g.:

```bash
$ mkdir az-python-storage-policy && cd az-python-storage-policy
$ pulumi policy new azure-python
```
