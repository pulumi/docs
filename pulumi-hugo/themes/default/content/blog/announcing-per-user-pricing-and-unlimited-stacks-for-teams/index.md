Since launching last year, thousands of users and hundreds of
companies, from startups to Fortune 500 Enterprises, have chosen Pulumi
for cloud applications and infrastructure delivery across AWS, Azure,
Google Cloud, and Kubernetes. Today we are announcing important changes
to better align our product and pricing with how we've heard you want to
use Pulumi in production. We're optimistic that these changes will help
companies of all sizes choose Pulumi, enabling their teams to deliver
cloud applications and infrastructure faster and more reliably.

The net result is three paid editions:

- **Team Starter Edition**: for teams just getting started with Pulumi
- **Team Pro Edition**: for medium to large teams using Pulumi at
  scale
- **Enterprise Edition**: for large organizations using Pulumi with
  advanced needs

**Pulumi Community Edition** remains unchanged, and is free for
unlimited individual use.

In addition to the product edition changes, we are moving away from per
stack pricing. We heard clear feedback from customers that per stack
pricing made it difficult to plan and budget for future growth, and that
it unintentionally penalized certain architectural decisions. The new
per user model should be more affordable and predictable.

Here is a summary of the resulting options. For full details, [view our pricing page](/pricing/).

## FAQ

Here are some common frequently asked questions about the pricing
structure:

### How do I get started?

To get started, simply sign up for free using your identity provider of
choice (ideally the same one your organization will be backed by). From
there, create an organization that your team members will use. To use
the free Community Edition, just [download the CLI](/docs/get-started/) and
sign into the free tier of the service when it prompts you.

### What is an organization?

An organization is a shared workspace for your business to collaborate
across multiple projects at once. Organizations may be backed by your
existing source control system (GitHub, GitLab, Atlassian), identity
provider (any SAML/SSO provider, including Okta and Active Directory),
or managed manually. Organization owners and administrators can manage
access to the organization's projects with security and administrative
features.

The key distinction between Pulumi's free Community Edition and its paid
offerings — Team Starter, Team Pro, and Enterprise — is the presence
of an organization. The Community Edition is meant for individuals using
Pulumi for their private projects, but this tends not to work in a team
setting. Most teams want multiple engineers to have access to their
projects. This is precisely what organizations deliver to you. The
advanced tiers offer even more sophisticated organization management
facilities, including RBAC for advanced policy controls.

### Can I start small and upgrade later?

Yes! We designed the editions to make it easy to get started with Team
Starter, and once you've outgrown it, upgrading to Team Pro is a single
click away. To upgrade to Enterprise, please [contact
us](/contact).

### I'm an existing customer on a per stack plan -- what do I do?

We are in the process of reaching out to all existing customers to offer
a switch to one of the new plans. If you haven't heard from us yet,
please don't hesitate to [drop us a
line](/contact). If now isn't the right time to change
for your team, however, don't worry — we are happy to honor your
existing subscription terms.

### Do you offer custom pricing for large teams?

We are always happy to discuss the best way to ensure Pulumi can work
for your team. To talk with a leader at the company, please simply [fill
out the contact us form](/contact) and we'll be
in touch.

### What payment options do you accept?

All subscriptions can be paid with a credit card (we use Stripe for
processing). The Pulumi Service is meant to be easy to sign up for, so feel free
to simply begin your trial, and then you may enter your credit card on
your organization's Settings page.

For annual subscriptions, we also offer invoicing that is payable with
bank transfer or check. To discuss those options in more detail, please
[contact us](/contact/).
