## What is DevOps in AI

When considering the adoption of AI and AI engineering, such as prompt engineering and other specific disciplines, AI engineers rely heavily on the cloud. Many AI-based systems are built around cloud-native tools, practices, and managed services.

The extensive use of cloud-native primitives means that AI is fundamentally a cloud adoption story. Consequently, established DevOps and infrastructure as code tooling and best practices play an important role in AI engineering, in what is being done, and in leveraging its use.

## What is AI in DevOps

Integrating AI in DevOps entails employing machine learning (ML) and other artificial intelligence technologies to automate and optimize various software development and delivery aspects, including tasks such as automating testing and deployment processes and refining resource management.

The incorporation of AI in DevOps can result in:

- Enhanced speed
- Improved resource management
- Increased reliability throughout the software development lifecycle

Consequently, organizations may experience swifter deployments, reduced errors, and heightened overall productivity. By substituting manual processes with automation and AI-powered solutions, DevOps teams can elevate product quality and more efficiently oversee their systems.

## How AI is Currently Used in DevOps

{{< figure alt="Luke Hoban at the San Francisco Pulumi Group meetup discussing the usage of AI, during the AI Talks for DevOps" src="./luke-nana-adora-discussing-devop-ai.png" caption="Luke Hoban at the San Francisco Pulumi Group meetup discussing the usage of AI, during the AI Talks for DevOps" width=100% >}}

DevOps significantly impacts all stages of the development and operations lifecycle. It has helped break silos and optimize to increase developer velocity and productivity, creating a positive impact on the ops side.

AI assists DevOps teams to refine their operations by detecting inefficiencies and triggering warnings as soon as issues appear. This technology also enables real-time observation of systems and applications, permitting prompt actions from operations personnel and minimizing downtime.

AI-driven automation can also help the software development process with code generation. The operations teams from both departments quickly pinpoint any issues in their workflows while speeding up decision-making processes.

In the long term, the AI may use cloud credentials to create and autonomously automate deployment and management and perform DevOps tasks on behalf of the DevOps or platform engineering team. In the near term, it is used to assist humans, from DevOps professionals to developers.

> ***“In the near term, AI usage in DevOps is about how do you keep the human in the loop, how do you use it as a learning tool, as a code generation tool, and for auditing to provide actionable notifications, all of which are still very human-dependent. There is so much more it can be used for. Currently, it's a tool serving humans. But it is fascinating to imagine it in the future when it can be trusted to be an autonomous agent.”*** - *Luke Hoban, CTO of Pulumi and co-creator of TypeScript*

So, how does this technology bring about these advancements? Two main ways are by streamlining development tasks and improving monitoring and security protocols.

### Streamlining Development Workflows

AI has the potential to significantly change the software development life cycle by automating routine processes, using resources efficiently, and offering solutions for improved code. DevOps teams can leverage AI-driven tools to increase effectiveness when managing their assets while also improving code quality, leading to faster project deliveries.

For instance, AI can identify any slowdowns during progress and recommend improvements, analyze root causes, and help make judicious decisions regarding resource allocation, ultimately resulting in efficient delivery of software products.

### Enhancing Monitoring and Security

The usage of AI significantly boosts DevOps monitoring and security. With the assistance of AI tools, operations teams can use machine learning algorithms to examine a massive amount of data to protect their applications from potential risks and enhance reliability. These algorithmic solutions provide valuable advice for development personnel, which helps strengthen protection measures while optimizing performance simultaneously.

## How Can a DevOps Team Take Advantage of Artificial Intelligence

A DevOps team can leverage AI in several ways to enhance efficiency, automation, and overall productivity. Here are some key strategies for a DevOps team to leverage AI:

### Code Generation and Learning

AI can be a powerful tool to make the development process much smoother. It can help engineers focus on what matters instead of searching for documentation on websites, developer forums, or search engines for answers to help solve specific problems. The perfect code snippet is often hard to find or may not even exist.

Generative AI, powered by LLMs, can help developers and DevOps engineers quickly discover, learn, and, for example, use new cloud infrastructure APIs.

{{< figure alt="Pulumi AI response to Run metabase in Azure, using TypeScript" src="https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-ai/run-metabase-in-azure.png" width=90%  caption="Pulumi AI response to Run metabase in Azure, using TypeScript" >}}

You can see it in practice [using Pulumi AI](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-ai/). You can use natural language to ask for a specific cloud infrastructure goal and obtain a corresponding Pulumi program in your preferred programming language. Moreover, Pulumi AI facilitates the iterative refinement of your cloud infrastructure, incorporating new features, enhancements to security and performance, resolution of correctness issues, and clarification of requirements. [Try Pulumi AI](https://www.pulumi.com/ai).

### Intelligent Resource Management

Platform and developer teams are spinning up resources across many cloud accounts within multiple cloud providers. It can be almost impossible to aggregate and search your infrastructure across these accounts since every cloud and every account is (by design!) a walled garden.

Often, to answer key questions about their business, such as “Which team has the largest cloud footprint?”, teams need to combine data across various clouds, cloud accounts, and SaaS tools. This prevents organizations from getting quick answers to operational questions and barriers to building aggregations to derive insights. AI can provide actionable insights over infrastructure with natural language processing (NLP) queries.

> ***“I can get developers using IaC immediately with Pulumi Deployments and its GitHub integration, while Pulumi Insights [Resource Search] makes it really easy to find idle developer environments that need to be shut down, which reduces our cloud costs”*** - *Santosh Dornal, Head of Software Test & DevOps, Alkira.*

When using Pulumi Cloud, you can leverage [AI Assist](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/ai-assist-improvements/). You can provide a plain English (Spanish, French, or Japanese) request to express queries where you might not know the exact syntax, type tokens, or package names. AI Assist makes it easier by providing answers to queries like:

- show me all s3 buckets not tagged in production
- show azure and azure native security groups
- show all AWS VPCs

### Remediation tool: Continuous and Automatic Compliance

Defining and managing security rules, criteria, and conditions are key to enabling security at scale. Policy as Code, or Compliance as Code, has the ability to verify and spot problems before deploying the infrastructure. When policies are written with code, you can apply software development practices such as testing, automated deployment, and version control.

AI can be valuable not just in anomaly detection but also in remediation, which doesn't just warn or error but can change the infrastructure directly to remediate compliance gaps. With Pulumi, [Remediation policies](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/remediation-policies/) can be configured and applied across any subset of stacks within an organization.

Consider the [unfortunate incident at GitLab](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-suffers-major-backup-failure-after-data-deletion-incident/), marked by a disastrous sequence of events resulting in the loss of segments of production databases and substantial user data.

{{< youtube "tLdRBsuvVKc?si=brUXETRY4Rew7954?rel=0" >}}

In this scenario, AI could have swiftly pinpointed the root cause and proposed a rapid solution, potentially mitigating the extent of damage before it escalated.

While the benefits of writing policies as code are evident for DevOps engineers, [the organizational benefits are even more significant](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/benefits-of-policy-as-code/).

### Enhance Collaboration and Communication

Nowadays, many professionals with DevOps in their titles are held accountable for the multiple aspects of Dev + Ops. At its core, DevOps is a cultural movement that removes barriers among teams and promotes collaboration and shared responsibility between dev and ops.

DevOps teams have seen great benefits from AI-driven tools, particularly in improving transparency, encouraging feedback, providing quick answers to common queries, and automating routine tasks. Many major companies, like Microsoft, use AI to build efficient workflows that make better decisions, leading to increased business outcomes. This includes smoother application delivery, a prime function of DevOps initiatives.

### Improved Product Delivery

Companies incorporating AI into their DevOps strategy reap the rewards of accelerated product delivery. This has been made possible through improved workflows, automated testing, and strengthened security measures, leading to greater efficiency in software development by allowing development and operations teams more scope for dealing with complex tasks using machine learning models. They can make better decisions, resulting in faster product delivery and enhanced business outcomes.

By streamlining existing systems within this context, customers can benefit from superior products delivered faster than before while companies provide and reinforce their business value.

### Planning and Cost Optimization

Implementing AI algorithms or AI tools that analyze usage patterns can assist in predicting future resource needs and optimize cloud infrastructure costs. This also ties in with intelligent resource management mentioned before, which can enhance cost efficiency, optimize resource allocation, and prevent unnecessary expenses.
