Policy as Code for Python is now GA in Pulumi 2.0. Policies written in code let you test, automate deployment, and enable version control. Python is a popular scripting language used for machine learning and artificial intelligence, data science, web development, and devops. It's an ideal language for developers and operators to use in common.

Devops benefits greatly from policy as code because policies can use software development practices and verify resources without deployments that are costly in time and money. Organizations can also gain significant benefits through cost savings, fine-grained control over infrastructure, efficient deployments, improved compliance, and better use of cloud provider native resources.

## How Policy as Code Works

Policies enforce specific criteria for a resource or a set of resources (stacks). For example, a common policy is to ensure that storage is not publicly accessible over the Internet or that virtual machines must have a firewall. Policies are enforced as either *advisory*, which prints a warning message the resource violates the policy; or
*mandatory*, which prevents a resource deployment if it violates the policy.

Pulumi supports two types of policies:

- **ResourceValidationPolicy** validates inputs of individual resources in a stack before the resource is created or modified.
- **StackValidationPolicy** validates outputs of all resources in the stack after all resources have been created or modified.

ResourceValidationPolicy and StackValidationPolicy validations run during previews and updates. During previews, resources aren't created or modified, so the ResourceValidationPolicy and StackValidationPolicy validations see a preview of what's going to happen (as best we can determine).
With stack validation policies, the validation happens after resources have been created or modified. Modifications to resources can't be prevented, but using mandatory enforcement results in a deployment failing (despite the modified resources). If you run `pulumi preview` before an update and use a mandatory StackValidationPolicy, you can catch the problems before a real deployment occurs.

The difference is described in this table:

|                                | Resource Validation                   | Stack Validation                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What does it check?            | Individual resources                  | All resources in the stack                                                           |
| When is the check performed?   | Before resources are created/modified | After all stack resources have been created/modified                                 |
| What information is available? | Resource _input_ properties           | Resource _output_ properties (Note: inputs are propagated to outputs during preview) |

Now that we have the basics of policy as code let's take a look at example policies written in Python.

## Examples

Policies are validation functions that validate resources in a Pulumi stack. In the examples below, we define a function that takes `ResourceValidationArgs` and `ReportViolation` as arguments. The function checks to see what type of resource and its arguments, these are used to determine if the resource violates the policy. If the resource is not compliant, the function reports the violation, and because the enforcement level is *mandatory*, the resource will not be deployed.

If you'd like to try out one of the examples, you can create a policy with `pulumi policy new` and run locally against a Pulumi program, specify `pulumi up --policy-pack <path-to-policy-pack>`.
