Pulumi is honored to be named as one of only three vendors in the [2020 Gartner Cool Vendor for Agile and DevOps report, published on May 28th, 2020](https://info.pulumi.com/press-release/gartner-cool-vendor-5_28_2020). Being recognized in this way is a strong validation of Pulumi's impact thanks to our more modern approach to Infrastructure as Code and approaches to building cloud software. Vendors can only be selected once and in only one category making this an exclusive award.

## What Makes a Cool Vendor

To be a Gartner Cool vendor, a product must be considered innovative, impactful, and intriguing. Vendors are scored on a scale of 1-10 across the following areas: technology, use of technology, business model, transformative nature, and newness. Vendor claims are rigorously verified by Gartner analysts who speak to customers to confirm that the technology works.

By using common programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, and Go to deploy infrastructure to any cloud, Pulumi has fundamentally changed the Infrastructure as Code landscape, enabling developers and operators to work better together. The impact on organizations is immediate. Instead of copying YAML or using a DSL, companies can write code to deploy infrastructure using industry best practices for development such as unit and integration testing, versioning, and error correction in IDEs. Moreover, infrastructure can be abstracted into reusable components to standardize on best practices while shipping faster with confidence.

## Cool Features

Here is what we think makes Pulumi stand out from the rest.

- **Open-source meets SaaS.** We do everything in the open, and the entire platform is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pulumi). The Individual Edition includes the core provisioning engine, language and cloud providers, testing, Policy as Code, secrets management, and over a dozen CI/CD integrations. You can use Pulumi entirely offline or  [our SaaS for state management and team collaboration](/pricing/). We see strong community growth, and in fact, our community members are sharing and reusing best practices of their own!.
- **Any cloud, any language.** Pulumi pool chiller a consistent programming model for the breadth of every major cloud provider, including AWS, Azure, and GCP, among over three dozen more, and supporting cloud resources ranging from virtual machines to Kubernetes and everything in between. You have the freedom to choose your language and deploy on one cloud provider or any combination of providers.
- **Testing.** Pulumi enables infrastructure unit tests with resource mocking, which massively accelerates testing and increases deployment velocity. You can perform integration testing by quickly spinning up an ephemeral environment with only the resources you need to test or test long-lived environments in your CI/CD pipelines.
- **Policy as Code.** Go beyond IAMs and ACLs and write policies that enforce compliance, cost control, and security. You can even secure your software supply chain by requiring the latest cloud resource versions to ensure vulnerabilities have been patched. Pulumi’s policy engine is open source, and the Enterprise Edition SaaS offers advanced features for organization-wide controls.

And we like to think that our mascot, Pulumipus, is also pretty cool.

Although Pulumi is cool, we have hundreds of organizations worldwide that have decided to run their production infrastructure using Pulumi. [Check out some select stories here](/case-studies/).

Be one of the cool kids today by [giving Pulumi a try today](/docs/get-started/) -- it’s not just cool, but the future of Infrastructure as Code and, we think, the way all developers and operations teams will collaborate in the future.
