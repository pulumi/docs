When we launched the [first-ever Cloud Engineering Summit](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyy8Vx2ZoWlpE6LxGPnfLfBQLbC7zX8FT) last year, we were humbled by the generosity and support from partners and sponsors across the industry who helped to make the summit a success. For [this year’s event](/cloud-engineering-summit), we’re equally thrilled to have an amazing group of sponsors participating in the summit and it’s worth a quick ‘guided tour’ of the teams that are helping us to pull off this amazing event.

## Amazon Web Services

AWS was an inaugural sponsor for the Cloud Engineering Summit with a talk from Alex Head about cost optimization. The AWS team returns again this year with four sessions: Emily Freeman will talk about _Rethinking the SDLC_, Rahul Sharma will share his team’s experience building the brand new [Cloud Control API](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-cloud-control-api) in _How AWS architects APIs for hyper-scale_, and Jenna Pederson will show you how to _Bring software development practices to your infrastructure_. Finally, Ken Exner will be chatting with Joe Duffy about the future of tooling for modern cloud infrastructure.

We’ll cap off the summit in a free, post-event workshop with Marina Novikova and Laura Santamaria showing you how to get started on AWS.

## Apple

New to the Cloud Engineering Summit this year, cloud services experts Fariba Khan and Stephen Van Gordon will share their experiences managing infrastructure at scale in Lifecycle of a Pulumi Program. They’ll talk about building a custom state backend, using CI/CD tooling, and the Pulumi Automation API to empower teams to provision secure-by-default configurations automatically.

## Google Cloud

Last year we hosted a fantastic talk from Jason (Jay) Smith who showed attendees how to stand up a serverless platform. This year, we’re proud to include Google Cloud as a sponsor and feature a keynote from Kelsey Hightower with Joe Duffy.

After the summit, you can also join Kat Cosgrove for free hands-on training showing you how to get started with Google Cloud.

## Microsoft

The 2020 Cloud Engineering Summit featured Amanda Silver in a Future of Cloud Engineering panel and Adora Nwodo showed everyone how to manage apps and infrastructure in a single CI/CD pipeline. Adora will return to the summit again this year to talk about _Software engineering in infrastructure engineering_.

For those looking to expand their cloud engineering skillset after the summit, Matt Stratton will host a workshop to show attendees how to get started with Azure.

## NGINX

We’ve spent a lot of time with the NGINX team over the past year in their quest to make it easier than ever to get to production with Kubernetes. Join first-time summit speakers Damian Curry and Elijah Zupancic for a lightning talk followed by NGINX office hours to learn about _Building a modern app reference architecture for Kubernetes_.

Then, if you’re ready for some hands-on Kubernetes help, join our post-event workshop [From Zero to Production in Kubernetes](/resources/from-zero-to-production-in-kubernetes/).

## Bridgecrew

New to the summit this year, Bridgecrew’s Steve Giguere is joining the Build track to share _Taking a Kubernetes Deployment from Default to Secure_.

## CircleCI

Long-time collaborator Angel Rivera from [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) joins the Deploy track to talk about _Building Arm Compatible CI/CD Pipelines_ and show you how to take advantage of Arm architectures in both your pipelines and workloads.

## GitHub

The GitHub team participated in three sessions last year including the Architectures and Platforms and Security and Policy panels. This year, the team returns with Rizel Bobb-Semple delivering a plenary session showing you how to get _From Code to Cloud_ without learning new tools.

## Honeycomb

If you missed Charity Major’s summit session last year about Testing In Production, stop reading and go watch it. Then, register for Liz Fong-Jones’s Build track session this year: _What is OpenTelemetry_.

## NS1

Last year, Johnathan Sullivan joined the Culture, Process, and Tools panel, and we’re excited to welcome Chris Buijs to this year’s Deploy panel.

## ...and many more

Beyond the teams and sessions mentioned above, the Cloud Engineering Summit wouldn’t be possible without help and support from a long list of sponsors and collaborators including Codefresh, Split, and Uffizzi. [Watch the replay today](/cloud-engineering-summit/replay/) to see what all the fuss is about.
