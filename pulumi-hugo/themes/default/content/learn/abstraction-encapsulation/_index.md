## Time

How long this tutorial will take depends on your internet connection, reading speed, and other factors. On average, this tutorial should take you about 25 minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following knowledge to complete this pathway:

- Completion of the [Pulumi Fundamentals](/learn/pulumi-fundamentals/) and [Building with Pulumi](/learn/building-with-pulumi/) pathways, OR have experience using Pulumi for other projects

Optionally, if you want to build some of the examples yourself to experiment, you'll need the following tools and skills:

- A [Pulumi account and token](/docs/pulumi-cloud/accounts#access-tokens)
    - If you don't have an account, go to the [signup page](https://app.pulumi.com/signup).
- The [Pulumi CLI](/docs/cli/commands/)
    - If you don't have the CLI, go to the [installation page](/docs/install/).
- An AWS account (the free version should be fine)
- Familiarity with either the TypeScript or Python programming language

## About this pathway

In this pathway, we will explore how you can use Pulumi as a tool to help you abstract and encapsulate your resource definitions as reusable models for others to use.
