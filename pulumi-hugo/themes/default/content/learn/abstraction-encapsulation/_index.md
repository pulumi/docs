## Time

How long this tutorial will take depends on your internet connection, reading speed, and other factors. On average, this tutorial should take you about 25 minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following knowledge to complete this pathway:

- Completion of the [Pulumi Fundamentals]({{< relref "/learn/pulumi-fundamentals" >}}) and [Building with Pulumi]({{< relref "/learn/building-with-pulumi" >}}) pathways, OR have experience using Pulumi for other projects

Optionally, if you want to build some of the examples yourself to experiment, you'll need the following tools and skills:

- A [Pulumi account and token]({{< relref "/docs/intro/pulumi-service/accounts#access-tokens" >}}) (If you don't have an account, go to the [signup page](https://app.pulumi.com/signup))
- An AWS account (the free version should be fine)
- Familiarity with the Python programming language

## About this pathway

In this pathway, we will explore how you can use Pulumi as a tool to help you abstract and encapsulate your resource definitions as reusable models for others to use.
