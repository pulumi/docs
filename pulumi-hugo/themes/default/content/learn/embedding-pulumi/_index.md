## Time

How long this tutorial will take depends on your internet connection, reading speed, and other factors. On average, this tutorial should take you about 30 minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools to complete this pathway:

- A [Pulumi account and token]({{< relref "/docs/intro/pulumi-service/accounts#access-tokens" >}})
  - If you don't have an account, go to the [signup page](https://app.pulumi.com/signup).

In addition, you should be able to

- code in Python

We recommend that you either have completed [Pulumi Fundamentals]({{< relref "/learn/pulumi-fundamentals" >}}) and [Building with Pulumi]({{< relref "/learn/building-with-pulumi" >}}) OR have experience using Pulumi for other projects.

## About this pathway

In this pathway, we will explore how you could use Pulumi as an API for your infrastructure deployment and maintenance.

Note that this pathway will not have a specific application and infrastructure to stand up. Rather, we're exploring the Pulumi system, so you can use either a code example of your own or one of ours.
