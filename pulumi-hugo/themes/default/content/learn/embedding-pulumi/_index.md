## Time

How long this tutorial will take depends on your internet connection, reading speed, and other factors. On average, this tutorial should take you about 30 minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools to complete this pathway:

- A [Pulumi account and token](/docs/intro/pulumi-cloud/accounts#access-tokens)
    - If you don't have an account, go to the [signup page](https://app.pulumi.com/signup).
- The [Pulumi CLI](/docs/reference/cli/)
    - If you don't have the CLI, go to the [installation page](/docs/get-started/install/).

In addition, you should be able to

- code in Python

We recommend that you either have completed [Pulumi Fundamentals](/learn/pulumi-fundamentals/) and [Building with Pulumi](/learn/building-with-pulumi/) OR have experience using Pulumi for other projects.

## About this pathway

In this pathway, we will explore how you could use Pulumi as an API for your infrastructure deployment and maintenance.

Note that this pathway will not have a specific application and infrastructure to stand up. Rather, we're exploring the Pulumi system, so you can use either a code example of your own or one of ours.
