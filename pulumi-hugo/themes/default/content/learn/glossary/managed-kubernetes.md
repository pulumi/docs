## Definition

A managed kubernetes service is a kubernetes platform where some or all of the responsibility for setup and maintenance lies with a third-party provider. The extent of services offered varies from vendor to vendor, but generally, using a managed kubernetes service shifts the responsibility for keeping the cluster online and updated from you to the vendor, as well as some or all of its maintenance.
