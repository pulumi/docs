> [Reference](/reference), which includes details about Pulumi concepts, programming model, and APIs.

Welcome!  We are excited that you want to learn Pulumi.  The Pulumi Quickstart teaches you how to:

1. [Set up your environment and build your first Pulumi program](./part1.html)
2. [Manage your infrastructure using Pulumi](./part2.html)
3. [Create programs that use containers and serverless functions](./part3.html)
4. [Deploy application and infrastructure code together using the same tools and workflows](./part4.html)
5. [Navigate our examples and reference documentation to learn more](./part5.html)

## Tutorials

For an introductory walkthrough of Pulumi, see the following tutorials:

* [Using Pulumi with AWS Infrastructure](./aws.html)
* [Using Pulumi for Cloud-Agnostic Serverless + Containers](./cloud.html)

## Additional Documentation

In addition to the tutorial, you can check out the reference documentation for information:

* [An overall introduction to Pulumi](../reference/index.html)
* [Learn the core concepts used by Pulumi programs](../reference/concepts.html)
* [Use JavaScript or TypeScript to program the cloud](../reference/javascript.html)
* [Use Python to program the cloud](../reference/python.html)

Much more is available in the table of contents available in [the reference section index](../reference/index.html).

## Code Examples

For code samples, see the following folders in the [Pulumi examples zipfile](/examples/pulumi-examples.zip):

- **webserver**. Create EC2 VMs using JavaScript. Companion to the [AWS infrastructure tutorial](./aws.html). 
- **url-shortener**. A complete URL shortener SPA that uses Pulumi's high-level cloud programming model.
- **serverless-raw**. Deploy a complete serverless C# application using lower-level AWS resources.
- **video-thumbnailer**. Generate keyframe thumbnails from videos uploaded to a bucket, using FFmpeg in a container.
