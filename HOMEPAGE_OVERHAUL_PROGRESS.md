# Homepage Overhaul Progress

## Overview
This document captures the progress made on implementing the website overhaul recommendations from RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf. The work was done on the `joeduffy/overhaul` branch.

## Starting Point
The original homepage suffered from:
- Diluted messaging trying to showcase 8+ products simultaneously
- Complex navigation with separate dropdowns for Products, Solutions, Learn, etc.
- Generic enterprise jargon mixed with developer content
- Poor conversion funnel with unclear CTAs
- Redundant content sections
- Weak developer onboarding experience

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Core Messaging & Hero Section
**Before:** Generic "The Cloud Infrastructure Platform" with long, unfocused description
**After:** 
- Clear headline: "Infrastructure as Code in Any Language"
- Compelling subtitle: "Open Source. Trusted by 3,500+ Customers"
- Punchy description: "Use TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, or Java to manage any cloud. No proprietary DSLs or YAML hell. Full IDE support. 90% less code. 5x faster deployments."
- Increased hero headline size from text-4xl/5xl to text-5xl/6xl for better visual impact

### 2. Code-First Experience
**Before:** Code examples buried deep in the page
**After:** 
- Code example placed directly alongside hero messaging (temporal.io style)
- Removed YAML from language options (contradicted "No YAML hell" messaging)
- Added automatic language randomization on page load
- Added 5-second auto-rotation through languages (stops on user interaction)
- Code window expands vertically as needed (no truncation or scrollbars)

### 3. Navigation Simplification
**Before:** 8 separate dropdowns with overlapping content
**After:** 3 focused dropdowns plus direct links
- **Platform** - Consolidated all products/capabilities
- **For Developers** - Get Started, Docs, Registry, Templates, Tutorials, Events, Community
- **For Enterprise** - Enterprise Solutions, Case Studies, Demo, Professional Services, Contact
- **Direct Links** - Docs, Blog, Pricing
- Removed redundant "Learn" dropdown (content redistributed to appropriate sections)

### 4. Homepage Content Consolidation
**Before:** Multiple redundant sections for each product
**After:**
- Removed 4 separate product pitch sections
- Consolidated testimonials and community into single section
- Simplified comparison table (cleaner styling, added deployment speed metric)
- Removed redundant "3,500 customers" heading (already in hero subtitle)
- Combined key metrics: "90% less code" and "5x faster from code to cloud"

### 5. Visual & Style Improvements
- Removed excessive shadows and borders for cleaner look
- Fixed broken logo paths (panther.svg, clear.png)
- Aligned hero content to top (prevents vertical shifting with code example)
- Improved responsive layout with proper flex containers
- Added subtle gradients and better spacing

### 6. Content Updates
- Changed "ESC" to "Secrets & Config" (removed acronym)
- Updated "Cost Insights" to "Cloud Intelligence" (more accurate)
- Restored missing Snowflake testimonial from Justin Fitzhugh
- Added "Events & Workshops" back to For Developers (was lost in nav cleanup)
- Updated customer count to 3,500+

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. `/content/_index.md` - Homepage content and metadata
2. `/layouts/index.html` - Homepage template structure
3. `/layouts/partials/header.html` - Navigation menu
4. `/layouts/partials/home/quick-start.html` - New streamlined getting started section
5. `/layouts/partials/home/why-pulumi.html` - New comparison table vs Terraform
6. `/content/product/infrastructure-as-code.md` - Updated product page messaging

### Key Metrics Highlighted
- **90% less code** than Terraform
- **5x faster deployments** 
- **3,500+ customers**
- **20k+ GitHub stars**
- **10k+ Slack members**
- **150+ cloud providers**

## What's Next (Not Yet Implemented)

From the original recommendations, these items remain:
1. **Mobile responsiveness improvements** - Further testing and optimization needed
2. **Enterprise vs developer paths** - Could be more distinct with separate landing pages
3. **Additional proof points** - More specific customer success metrics
4. **A/B testing** - Set up experiments for different messaging variants
5. **Conversion optimization** - Track and improve CTA click-through rates
6. **Search functionality** - Better on-site search experience
7. **Interactive demos** - Live playground for trying Pulumi

## Quick Wins Still Available
1. Add customer logos animation/carousel
2. Create dedicated "Start Free Trial" CTA (more action-oriented)
3. Add "Book a Demo" to hero for enterprise visitors
4. Include specific customer metrics (e.g., "Mercedes-Benz deploys 50% faster")
5. Add trust badges (SOC2, ISO, etc.) for enterprise credibility

## Testing Notes
- Site runs locally at http://localhost:1313
- Use `make serve` to run with hot reload
- Pre-commit hooks enforce meta description length (<160 chars)
- Hugo server may need restart after partial template changes

## Git Status
All changes are on the `joeduffy/overhaul` branch, not yet committed. Ready for review and commit when appropriate.
