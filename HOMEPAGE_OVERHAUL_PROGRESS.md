# Homepage Overhaul Progress

## Overview
This document captures the progress made on implementing the website overhaul recommendations from RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf. The work was done on the `joeduffy/overhaul` branch.

## Current Status
- **Phase 1**: âœ… Complete - Major structural changes and messaging improvements
- **Phase 2**: âœ… Complete - Quick wins implementation (CTAs, metrics, trust badges)
- **Phase 3**: ðŸ”„ Planning - Mobile optimization, interactive demos, A/B testing

## Impact Summary
- **Clearer messaging**: "Infrastructure as Code in Any Language" now front and center
- **Improved CTAs**: More action-oriented with "Start for Free" and "Book a Demo"
- **Better social proof**: Customer testimonials now include specific metrics
- **Enterprise credibility**: Added trust badges for security/compliance
- **Simplified navigation**: Reduced from 8 to 3 main dropdowns + direct links

## Starting Point
The original homepage suffered from:
- Diluted messaging trying to showcase 8+ products simultaneously
- Complex navigation with separate dropdowns for Products, Solutions, Learn, etc.
- Generic enterprise jargon mixed with developer content
- Poor conversion funnel with unclear CTAs
- Redundant content sections
- Weak developer onboarding experience

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Core Messaging & Hero Section
**Before:** Generic "The Cloud Infrastructure Platform" with long, unfocused description
**After:** 
- Clear headline: "Infrastructure as Code in Any Language"
- Compelling subtitle: "Open Source. Trusted by 3,500+ Customers"
- Punchy description: "Use TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, or Java to manage any cloud. No proprietary DSLs or YAML hell. Full IDE support. 90% less code. 5x faster deployments."
- Increased hero headline size from text-4xl/5xl to text-5xl/6xl for better visual impact

### 2. Code-First Experience
**Before:** Code examples buried deep in the page
**After:** 
- Code example placed directly alongside hero messaging (temporal.io style)
- Removed YAML from language options (contradicted "No YAML hell" messaging)
- Added automatic language randomization on page load
- Added 5-second auto-rotation through languages (stops on user interaction)
- Code window expands vertically as needed (no truncation or scrollbars)

### 3. Navigation Simplification
**Before:** 8 separate dropdowns with overlapping content
**After:** 3 focused dropdowns plus direct links
- **Platform** - Consolidated all products/capabilities
- **For Developers** - Get Started, Docs, Registry, Templates, Tutorials, Events, Community
- **For Enterprise** - Enterprise Solutions, Case Studies, Demo, Professional Services, Contact
- **Direct Links** - Docs, Blog, Pricing
- Removed redundant "Learn" dropdown (content redistributed to appropriate sections)

### 4. Homepage Content Consolidation
**Before:** Multiple redundant sections for each product
**After:**
- Removed 4 separate product pitch sections
- Consolidated testimonials and community into single section
- Simplified comparison table (cleaner styling, added deployment speed metric)
- Removed redundant "3,500 customers" heading (already in hero subtitle)
- Combined key metrics: "90% less code" and "5x faster from code to cloud"

### 5. Visual & Style Improvements
- Removed excessive shadows and borders for cleaner look
- Fixed broken logo paths (panther.svg, clear.png)
- Aligned hero content to top (prevents vertical shifting with code example)
- Improved responsive layout with proper flex containers
- Added subtle gradients and better spacing

### 6. Content Updates
- Changed "ESC" to "Secrets & Config" (removed acronym)
- Updated "Cost Insights" to "Cloud Intelligence" (more accurate)
