# Pulumi CLI

The `pulumi` CLI supports creating, configuring and updating Pulumi stacks.

An __stack__ represents a running Pulumi program.  `pulumi stack init` creates a new Pulumi stack for the
program in the working directory. Multiple stacks can be managed in a single program directory, and you can
see all environments with `pulumi stack ls`.

Each environment has an associated set of __config__.  The config is a set of key value pairs which are available to
your Pulumi program.

The running application can be __updated__, combining the current config with the current version of the program in the
working directory and deploying those updates into the running application---updating any necessary infrastructure and
deploying any new code or resources into the application.

An update can be __previewed__, displaying a summary of the expected changes that will be made during an update
operation based on the current state of the program and config.  This preview is a conservative summary---it will
include updates which may not need to be made depending on the results of applying some of the changes to the target
infrastructure.

```

## pulumi stack

```
Manage stacks

An stack is a named update target, and a single project may have many of them.
Each stack has a configuration and update history associated with it, stored in
the workspace, in addition to a full checkpoint of the last known good update.

Usage:
  pulumi stack [flags]
  pulumi stack [command]

Available Commands:
  init        Create an empty stack with the given name, ready for updates
  ls          List all known stacks
  rm          Remove an stack and its configuration
  select      Switch the current workspace to the given stack

Flags:
  -h, --help        help for stack
  -i, --show-ids    Display each resource's provider-assigned unique ID
  -u, --show-urns   Display each resource's Pulumi-assigned globally unique URN

Global Flags:
  -C, --cwd string       Run pulumi as if it had been started in another directory
      --logflow          Flow log settings to child processes (like plugins)
      --logtostderr      Log to stderr instead of to files
      --tracing string   Emit tracing to a Zipkin-compatible tracing endpoint
  -v, --verbose int      Enable verbose logging (e.g., v=3); anything >3 is very verbose

Use "pulumi stack [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## pulumi config

```
Lists all configuration values for a specific stack. To add a new configuration value, run
'pulumi config set', to remove and existing value run 'pulumi config rm'. To get the value of
for a specific configuration key, use 'pulumi config get <key-name>'.

Usage:
  pulumi config [flags]
  pulumi config [command]

Available Commands:
  get         Get a single configuration value
  rm          Remove configuration value
  set         Set configuration value

Flags:
  -h, --help           help for config
      --show-secrets   Show secret values when listing config instead of displaying blinded values
  -s, --stack string   Operate on a different stack than the currently selected stack

Global Flags:
  -C, --cwd string       Run pulumi as if it had been started in another directory
      --logflow          Flow log settings to child processes (like plugins)
      --logtostderr      Log to stderr instead of to files
      --tracing string   Emit tracing to a Zipkin-compatible tracing endpoint
  -v, --verbose int      Enable verbose logging (e.g., v=3); anything >3 is very verbose

Use "pulumi config [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## pulumi update

```
Update the resources in an stack

This command updates an existing stack whose state is represented by the
existing snapshot file. The new desired state is computed by compiling and evaluating an
executable package, and extracting all resource allocations from its resulting object graph.
These allocations are then compared against the existing state to determine what operations
must take place to achieve the desired state. This command results in a full snapshot of the
stack's new resource state, so that it may be updated incrementally again later.

The package to execute is loaded from the current directory. Use the `-C` or `--cwd` flag to
use a different directory.

Usage:
  pulumi update [flags]

Aliases:
  update, up

Flags:
      --analyzer stringSlice     Run one or more analyzers as part of this update
  -d, --debug                    Print detailed debugging output during resource operations
  -h, --help                     help for update
  -p, --parallel int             Allow P resource operations to run in parallel at once (<=1 for no parallelism)
      --show-config              Show configuration keys and variables
      --show-replacement-steps   Show detailed resource replacement creates and deletes instead of a single step (default true)
      --show-sames               Show resources that needn't be updated because they haven't changed, alongside those that do
  -s, --stack string             Choose an stack other than the currently selected one
      --summary                  Only display summarization of resources and operations

Global Flags:
  -C, --cwd string       Run pulumi as if it had been started in another directory
      --logflow          Flow log settings to child processes (like plugins)
      --logtostderr      Log to stderr instead of to files
      --tracing string   Emit tracing to a Zipkin-compatible tracing endpoint
  -v, --verbose int      Enable verbose logging (e.g., v=3); anything >3 is very verbose
```

## pulumi preview

```
Show a preview of updates an stack's resources

This command displays a preview of the updates to an existing stack whose state is
represented by an existing snapshot file. The new desired state is computed by compiling
and evaluating an executable package, and extracting all resource allocations from its
resulting object graph. These allocations are then compared against the existing state to
determine what operations must take place to achieve the desired state. No changes to the
stack will actually take place.

The package to execute is loaded from the current directory. Use the `-C` or `--cwd` flag to
use a different directory.

Usage:
  pulumi preview [flags]

Aliases:
  preview, pre

Flags:
      --analyzer stringSlice     Run one or more analyzers as part of this preview
  -d, --debug                    Print detailed debugging output during resource operations
  -h, --help                     help for preview
  -p, --parallel int             Allow P resource operations to run in parallel at once (<=1 for no parallelism)
      --show-config              Show configuration keys and variables
      --show-replacement-steps   Show detailed resource replacement creates and deletes instead of a single step
      --show-sames               Show resources that needn't be updated because they haven't changed, alongside those that do
  -s, --stack string             Choose an stack other than the currently selected one
      --summary                  Only display summarization of resources and operations

Global Flags:
  -C, --cwd string       Run pulumi as if it had been started in another directory
      --logflow          Flow log settings to child processes (like plugins)
      --logtostderr      Log to stderr instead of to files
      --tracing string   Emit tracing to a Zipkin-compatible tracing endpoint
  -v, --verbose int      Enable verbose logging (e.g., v=3); anything >3 is very verbose
