- Provide substantial value compared to other pages in search results
- Satisfy the user's need without requiring additional searches

**E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness):**

## AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) Sources

### AI Search Behavior Research

**Key findings from industry research (Amsive, Conductor, SEOMator):**

1. **Listicles dominate AI citations** - 32% of AI citations come from listicle-format content
2. **Semantic chunking matters** - Structure content so each paragraph addresses one specific concept
3. **Date signals increase citation** - Including current year in titles/meta descriptions improves AI selection
4. **Tables are easily extracted** - AI systems prefer structured comparison tables
5. **Answer-first structure** - Put the direct answer in the opening paragraph

### AEO Best Practices

**Content Structure:**
- Lead with a clear, quotable definition or answer
- Use semantic chunking (one concept per section)
- Include FAQ sections for common questions
- Use structured tables for comparisons
- Make factual claims specific and citable (include numbers, dates)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Implement FAQ schema for Q&A content
- Ensure pages are crawlable by AI bots
- Use clean HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Include structured data markup where appropriate

4. **Hidden text** - Text hidden from users but visible to crawlers
