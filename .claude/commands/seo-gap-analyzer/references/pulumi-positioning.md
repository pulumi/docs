# Pulumi Positioning and Messaging Reference

Use this reference to align content recommendations with Pulumi's messaging framework.

## Master Positioning

**Tagline:** "Infrastructure as Code Platform, Now with Agentic AI"

**Positioning Statement:** "Pulumi is the comprehensive infrastructure as code platform trusted by thousands of teams worldwide. We unify infrastructure as code, secrets management, policy governance, and agentic AI in one platform—helping teams ship faster, scale confidently, and enable secure developer self-service without sacrificing control."

## Key Differentiators

When creating or optimizing content, emphasize these differentiators where relevant:

1. **Unified IaC Platform**: Everything teams need in one place vs. stitching together disconnected tools
2. **Real Programming Languages**: TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, Java—not proprietary DSLs like HCL
3. **Agentic AI Integration (Neo)**: AI that understands infrastructure context, not generic automation
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI handles complexity, humans maintain control and governance
5. **Proven at Scale**: 8+ years of infrastructure intelligence across thousands of teams
6. **Developer-Native Design**: Built for developers using real programming languages

## Identity-Based Positioning (vs. Competitors)

**Pulumi:** Built for Software Development Teams
- Use programming languages your team already knows
- Software development mindset with testing, debugging, version control
- Infrastructure as actual code, not configuration files

**Terraform:** Built for Traditional IT Operations
- Proprietary HCL language
- Infrastructure operations mindset
- Configuration management approach

## Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

Content should connect to these customer outcomes:

### Job 1: "Ship Faster Without Breaking Things"
- Deploy 3-5x faster with built-in testing, previews, rollback
- Eliminate custom workarounds required by traditional IaC tools
- Metrics: deployment frequency, change failure rate, MTTR

### Job 2: "Multiply Team Capacity Without Adding Headcount"
- Small platform teams support complexity that would require much larger teams
- Automation, reusable components, self-service capabilities
- Metrics: infrastructure managed per engineer, developer-to-platform-engineer ratio

### Job 3: "Enable Developer Self-Service Without Losing Control"
- Developers provision what they need while platform teams maintain oversight
- Support multi-cloud, multi-tenant, customer-specific configurations
- Metrics: self-service fulfillment rate, policy violation rate

## Audience Value Propositions

### Platform Engineers
- "Deploy infrastructure faster using programming languages you already know"
- Care about: familiar tools, reusable components, reducing operational toil
- Language: "policy as code," "software development lifecycle," "version control"

### Engineering Managers
- "Stop being the bottleneck between your business and development speed"
- Care about: scaling team impact, proving ROI, transformation without sacrificing governance
- Language: "platform ROI," "developer velocity," "executive dashboards"

### Executives
- "Accelerate innovation while reducing infrastructure risk and cost"
- Care about: business agility, cost optimization, risk reduction, measurable outcomes
- Language: "competitive differentiation," "infrastructure costs," "compliance"

## Competitive Positioning Quick Reference

| Competitor | Pulumi Advantage |
|------------|------------------|
| Terraform/HCL | Real programming languages vs. proprietary DSL; software dev culture vs. IT ops |
| AWS CDK/CloudFormation | Multi-cloud vs. vendor lock-in; programming languages vs. YAML |
| Crossplane | Works without Kubernetes; lower barrier to entry |
| CSPM Tools | Prevention vs. detection; developer workflow integration |

## Content Tone Guidelines

- **Technical authenticity**: Developer-native language over corporate buzzwords
- **Evidence-based**: Lead with proven customer results, not aspirational goals
- **Multi-audience**: Clear value for engineers, managers, and executives simultaneously
- **Heritage-forward**: Lead with platform capabilities before AI features
