# Keyword Strategy Framework

## Unbranded vs. Branded Keywords

### Unbranded Keywords (PRIMARY FOCUS)

Unbranded keywords do not include "Pulumi" in the search query. They should be the primary focus because they:

- Have higher search volume
- Capture users earlier in the discovery journey
- Build awareness among people who don't yet know Pulumi
- Are more competitive but more valuable for growth

**Examples:**
- "configuration management"
- "infrastructure as code"
- "secrets management kubernetes"
- "policy as code tutorial"

### Branded Keywords (SECONDARY)

Branded keywords include "Pulumi" in the search query. They are important but secondary because:

- Lower search volume
- Users already have Pulumi awareness
- Often easier to rank for (less competition)
- Important for conversion but not discovery

**Examples:**
- "pulumi configuration management"
- "pulumi vs terraform"
- "pulumi esc tutorial"

## Keyword Priority Framework

| Keyword Type | Example | Priority | Goal |
|--------------|---------|----------|------|
| **Unbranded - Head** | "configuration management" | HIGH | Compete for awareness |
| **Unbranded - Long-tail** | "configuration management for kubernetes" | HIGH | Capture specific intent |
| **Branded - Comparative** | "pulumi vs ansible" | MEDIUM | Win consideration |
| **Branded - Navigational** | "pulumi command provider" | LOW | Already ranking likely |

## Keyword Variant Generation

For any target topic, generate these variant types:

### Intent-Based Variants

| Intent | Pattern | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Informational | "what is [topic]" | "what is configuration management" |
| Educational | "[topic] tutorial" | "configuration management tutorial" |
| Commercial | "[topic] tools" | "configuration management tools" |
| Comparison | "[topic] vs [alternative]" | "ansible vs terraform configuration" |

### Modifier-Based Variants

| Modifier Type | Examples |
|---------------|----------|
| Technology | "[topic] kubernetes", "[topic] aws" |
| Use case | "[topic] best practices", "[topic] security" |
| Audience | "[topic] for developers", "[topic] enterprise" |
| Format | "[topic] guide", "[topic] examples" |
