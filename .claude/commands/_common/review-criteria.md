# Review Criteria

Use the repository's CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and STYLE-GUIDE.md for guidance on style and conventions.

Provide your review as a single summary, highlighting any issues found and suggesting improvements.

Be constructive and helpful in your feedback, but don't overdo the praise. Be concise.

Always provide relevant line numbers for any issues you identify.

**Criteria:**

- Always enforce `STYLE-GUIDE.md`. If not covered there, fall back to the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
- Check **spelling and grammar** in all files.
- Confirm that **all links resolve** and point to the correct targets (no 404s, no mislinked paths).
- Validate that **content is accurate and current** (commands, APIs, terminology).
- Ensure **all new files end with a newline**.
- Double-check indented lines to ensure they are not incorrectly indented as code blocks.
- **Code examples** must run correctly and follow best practices:
  - Do not suggest untested code.
  - Examples should show realistic use cases, not contrived demos.
  - Examples should handle errors appropriately.
  - Examples should follow language-specific best practices.
- **Files moved, renamed, or deleted**:
  - Confirm that moved or renamed files have appropriate aliases added to the frontmatter to avoid broken links.
  - Confirm that deleted files have a redirect created, if applicable.
- **Build, test, and infrastructure changes**:
  - If changes are made to build scripts (scripts/), GitHub Actions workflows (.github/workflows/), the Makefile, or infrastructure code (infrastructure/), verify that BUILD-AND-DEPLOY.md has been updated to reflect these changes.
  - Examples of changes requiring documentation updates: new make targets, modified deployment workflows, infrastructure configuration changes, new environment variables, updated build processes.
  - **High-risk changes**: Flag infrastructure changes (infrastructure/, package.json, webpack config, Lambda@Edge, CloudFront) and Dependabot dependency updates that affect runtime/bundling. **Your role is to identify and flag risks for human review**—see [Infrastructure Change Review](../../../BUILD-AND-DEPLOY.md#infrastructure-change-review) and [Dependency Management](../../../BUILD-AND-DEPLOY.md#dependency-management) sections in BUILD-AND-DEPLOY.md for risk details. Key risks: Lambda@Edge bundling (ESM/CommonJS, webpack changes), large dependency batches, runtime dependencies (marked, algolia, stencil), CloudFront changes
- **Images and assets**:
  - Check images have alt text for accessibility.
  - Verify image file sizes are reasonable.
  - Ensure images are in appropriate formats.
- **Front matter**:
  - Verify required front matter fields (title, description, etc.).
  - Check meta descriptions are present and appropriate length.
- **Cross-references and consistency**:
  - Check that related pages are cross-linked appropriately.
  - Verify terminology is consistent with other docs.
- **SEO**:
  - Check that page titles and descriptions are SEO-friendly.
  - Check that the titles and descriptions match the content.
  - Verify URL structure follows conventions.
- **Role-Specific Review Guidelines**
  - Documentation and blog/marketing materials have additional role-specific criteria below.

## Role-Specific Review Guidelines

### Documentation

When reviewing **Documentation**, serve the role of a professional technical writer. Review for:

- Clarity and conciseness.
- Logical flow and structure.
- No jargon unless defined.
- Avoid passive voice.
- Avoid overly complex sentences. Shorter is usually better.
- Avoid superlatives and vague qualifiers.
- Avoid unnecessary filler words or sentences.
- Be specific and provide examples.
- Use consistent terminology.

### Blogs or Marketing Materials

When reviewing **Blog posts or marketing materials**, serve the role of a professional technical blogger. Review for:

- Clear, engaging titles.
- Strong opening that hooks the reader.
- Clear structure with headings and subheadings.
- Concise paragraphs (3-4 sentences max).
- Use of lists and bullet points for readability.
- Reject filler, vague generalities, or AI-generated slop.
- Avoid clickbait phrasing.
- Clear call-to-action at the end.

## Additional Instructions

When blog posts introduce or announce new Pulumi features, providers, or significant functionality changes:

1. Check if corresponding documentation exists in `content/docs/` for the feature being announced
2. Verify that documentation, tutorials, or guides adequately cover the new functionality
3. If documentation is missing or incomplete, note this in your review with:
    - Specific gaps identified (e.g., "No ESC integration guide found")
    - Suggested documentation locations (e.g., "Should add to `content/docs/esc/guides/`")
    - Recommended documentation type (tutorial, concept guide, reference, etc.)
