## pulumi stack init

Create an empty stack with the given name, ready for updates

### Synopsis

Create an empty stack with the given name, ready for updates

This command creates an empty stack with the given name.  It has no resources,
but afterwards it can become the target of a deployment using the `update` command.

To create a stack in an organization, prefix the stack name with the organization name
and a slash (e.g. 'acmecorp/dev')

```
pulumi stack init [<org-name>/]<stack-name> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                      help for init
      --secrets-provider string   The name of the provider that should be used to encrypt and decrypt secrets.
