## pulumi stack export

Export a stack's deployment to standard out

### Synopsis


Export a stack's deployment to standard out.

The deployment can then be hand-edited and used to update the stack via
`pulumi stack import`. This process may be used to correct inconsistencies
in a stack's state due to failed deployments, manual changes to cloud
resources, etc.

```
pulumi stack export [flags]

  -h, --help           help for export
