## pulumi update

Update the resources in a stack

### Synopsis


Update the resources in a stack.

This command updates an existing stack whose state is represented by the existing checkpoint
file. The new desired state is computed by running a Pulumi program, and extracting all resource
allocations from its resulting object graph. These allocations are then compared against the
existing state to determine what operations must take place to achieve the desired state. This
command results in a checkpoint containing a full snapshot of the stack's new resource state, so
that it may be updated incrementally again later.

The program to run is loaded from the project in the current directory. Use the `-C` or
`--cwd` flag to use a different directory.

```
pulumi update [flags]
```
