## pulumi destroy

Destroy an existing stack and its resources

### Synopsis

Destroy an existing stack and its resources

This command deletes an entire existing stack by name.  The current state is
loaded from the associated state file in the workspace.  After running to completion,
all of this stack's resources and associated state will be gone.

Warning: this command is generally irreversible and should be used with great care.
