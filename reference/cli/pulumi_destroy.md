## pulumi destroy

Destroy an existing stack and its resources

### Synopsis


Destroy an existing stack and its resources

This command deletes an entire existing stack by name.  The current state is
loaded from the associated snapshot file in the workspace.  After running to completion,
all of this stack's resources and associated state will be gone.

Warning: although old snapshots can be used to recreate a stack, this command
is generally irreversible and should be used with great care.
