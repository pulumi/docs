## pulumi preview

Show a preview of updates to a stack's resources

### Synopsis


Show a preview of updates a stack's resources.

This command displays a preview of the updates to an existing stack whose state is
represented by an existing snapshot file. The new desired state is computed by running
a Pulumi program, and extracting all resource allocations from its resulting object graph.
These allocations are then compared against the existing state to determine what
operations must take place to achieve the desired state. No changes to the stack will
actually take place.

The program to run is loaded from the project in the current directory. Use the `-C` or
`--cwd` flag to use a different directory.

```
