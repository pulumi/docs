## pulumi state delete

Deletes a resource from a stack's state

### Synopsis


Deletes a resource from a stack's state
		
This command deletes a resource from a stack's state, as long as it is safe to do so. Resources can't be deleted if
there exist other resources that depend on it or are parented to it. Protected resources will not be deleted unless
it is specifically requested using the --force flag.

```
