## pulumi cancel

Cancel a stack's currently running update, if any

### Synopsis


Cancel a stack's currently running update, if any.

This command cancels the update currently being applied to a stack if any exists.
Note that this operation is _very dangerous_, and may leave the stack in an
inconsistent state if a resource operation was pending when the update was canceled.

After this command completes successfully, the stack will be ready for further
updates.

```
pulumi cancel [<stack-name>] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for cancel
  -y, --yes    Skip confirmation prompts, and proceed with cancellation anyway
```
