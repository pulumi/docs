# Pulumi

> Modern Infrastructure as Code platform that lets you use real programming languages to build and deploy cloud infrastructure across any cloud provider.

Pulumi is the universal infrastructure as code platform that enables developers, platform teams, and enterprises to build, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Unlike traditional Infrastructure as Code tools that use domain-specific languages, Pulumi supports TypeScript, Python, Go, .NET, Java, and YAML.
