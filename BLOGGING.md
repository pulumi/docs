# Writing and Publishing a Pulumi Blog Post

So you're interested in contributing to the Pulumi blog? Great! Follow these
steps to make it happen.

## Quick Start: Creating a Blog Post with Claude Code

The easiest way to create a new blog post is with the `/new-blog-post` command in Claude Code.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) installed
- This repository cloned
- Git configured with your name and email

**Steps:**

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b your-initials/your-post-slug`
2. Run `/new-blog-post` in Claude Code
3. Answer the interactive prompts (title, summary, tags, etc.)

**What the command does for you:**

- Detects your author information from git config
- Finds your existing author profile or creates one for you
- Suggests relevant tags based on your title
- Generates a meta description suggestion
- Handles multi-author posts
- Creates the blog post directory structure
- Adds a placeholder meta image (replace with your own 1200×630 PNG)

Once complete, you'll have a new blog post ready for writing at `content/blog/[your-slug]/index.md`.

**Next steps:** Jump to [Write Your Post](#write-your-post) to learn about formatting and media.

## Set Up Your Development Environment

If you haven't already, clone this repository and
[follow the instructions in the README](https://github.com/pulumi/docs)
to set up your environment and run the development web server.

Once you're able to run:

```zsh
make serve
```

If you can browse the site locally at http://localhost:1313/ then you are ready to
proceed to the next section.

## Write Your Post

Once you've created your post structure with `/new-blog-post`, focus on writing great content. Posts are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and rendered with [BlackFriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday), Hugo's default Markdown processor. GitHub's [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) guide is a helpful syntax reference if you need it. You can also include HTML in your posts, if you need greater control over the output than Markdown can provide.

For formatting guidelines, see [the Style Guide](./STYLE-GUIDE.md).

### Code Blocks

There are a couple of ways to do [syntax highlighting](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/) in Hugo, but we generally recommend [code fences](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlight-in-code-fences), along with an optional language specifier &mdash; e.g., for TypeScript:

<pre>
```typescript
let bucket = new aws.s3.BucketV2("stuff");
...
```
</pre>

[Additional languages are available](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#list-of-chroma-highlighting-languages) as well.

### Media

#### Inline Images

To add images to the body of your post, first place them within the folder containing the post's Markdown file (e.g., at `blog/my-new-post/platypus.png`), then reference them relatively:

```
![The humble platypus](platypus.png)
```

#### Social ("Meta") Images

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are adding _any_ logos to the meta image, you must absolutely ensure these are current. Using a wrong or outdated logo can have a severe negative impact on social sharing timelines due caching.

When you generate a new post, an [OpenGraph](http://ogp.me/) placeholder image is included for you, and a reference to that image is added to the post's frontmatter as well, as its `meta_image`. The `meta_image` is meant to accompany the post in social previews (Twitter cards, unfurled Slack links, etc.) and on the Pulumi blog home page. It's optional, but recommended, as it can help to make your post more attractive and informative.

For best results, we suggest the following specs for the `meta_image`, largely based on [Twitter's dev docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards):

| Aspect Ratio | Recommended Size | Format | Background               |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| 2:1          | 1200×630         | PNG    | Opaque (No Transparency) |

Remember to replace the `meta_image` placeholder (or remove the property altogether and delete the placeholder `meta.png` file) before submitting your post.

For help creating your `meta_image`, check out our [Build Your Own Meta Image file](https://www.figma.com/file/TnD7nxjIxVvXq8w0W7awPG/Build-Your-Own-Meta-Image?node-id=0%3A1) in Figma. There you’ll find backgrounds, images, and logos to assemble the `meta_image` for your blog post.

To use Pulumi's primary brand font Gilroy in your `meta_image`, first [download Gilroy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1893zFNypEQTvZU0J2Bz5_mVx6xa_7Zxh/view?usp=sharing) and install the file to your local font folder. Then [download the Figma font installer](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) to access your local fonts in Figma.

A few things to keep in mind when designing a `meta image`:

- Avoid placing important text or graphic elements too close to the edges of the frame — elements at the edges may get cropped at some display ratios
- Try to include at least one Pulumi identifier (word mark, Pulumipus) so viewers can tell at a glance that the image belongs to the Pulumi blog
- Use dark text on light backgrounds, and light text on dark backgrounds to ensure readability
- Remember to zoom out from your image and confirm it looks as you intend at a thumbnail size

#### Video

To embed a YouTube video, you can use Hugo's built-in [`youtube` shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#youtube), which takes the video's YouTube ID, obtainable from its public URL on youtube.com:

```plain
{{< youtube "kDB-YRKFfYE?rel=0" >}}
```

For videos belonging to the [Pulumi YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Dhyn4Ev52YSbcpfnfP0Mw), you'll usually want to append the `?rel=0` query parameter as well (as above), which tells YouTube to limit the suggestions it makes at the end of a video to those from the same YouTube channel. [Learn more about player parameters here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters).

#### GitHub Repository Cards

To embed a GitHub repository preview card, use the `github-card` shortcode with the repository in `owner/repo` format:

```plain
{{< github-card repo="pulumi/pulumi" >}}
```

This renders a clickable card showing the repository's Open Graph image, which includes the repository name, description, stars, language, and other metadata. The card links directly to the repository on GitHub.

#### Neo Cards

To embed a card linking to Pulumi Neo with a pre-filled prompt, use the `neo-card` shortcode:

```plain
{{< neo-card title="Migrate your CDK application" >}}
{{< neo-card title="Migrate your CDK application" prompt="Leverage the cdk-to-pulumi skill to migrate my CDK application to a Pulumi application" >}}
{{< neo-card title="Try Neo" subtitle="Get started" prompt="Help me create infrastructure" >}}
```

**Parameters:**
- `title` (required): The main text displayed on the card
- `prompt` (optional): The prompt sent to Neo (defaults to title if not specified)
- `subtitle` (optional): The smaller text above title (default: "Start a Neo task")

This renders a card with the Neo icon, subtitle, title, and a chevron arrow. Clicking the card opens Pulumi Neo with the specified prompt.

#### Animated GIFs

GIFs are welcome, but should be optimized. In general, animated GIFs should be no more than 1200 pixels wide and 3 MB in size. If you need help optimizing your GIF, consider [Gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/); it's available through Homebrew and has an easy-to-use command-line API. For example, to resize (e.g., downscale) and optimize a GIF in place:

```bash
gifsicle ./my-animation.gif --resize-width=1200 --optimize=3 --batch
```

## Review and Publish

Before submitting your post:

1. **Review for quality**: Run `/docs-review` in Claude Code to check for style and content issues
2. **Add borders to images**: If you have screenshots, run `/add-borders` to add 1px grey borders for better visual clarity
3. **Preview locally**: Run `make serve` and check your post at http://localhost:1313/blog/[your-slug]
4. **Replace the placeholder meta image**: Create a custom 1200×630 PNG for social media previews (see [meta image guidelines](#social-meta-images) above)
5. **Submit for review**: Create a Pull Request against the `master` branch
6. **Publicize**: Before merge, reach out in [#blogs](https://pulumi.slack.com/archives/CCBFCGU94) so Marketing can help broadcast your post

Once merged to master, your post will go live on https://www.pulumi.com/ (after its publish date).

## A Note on Dates and Scheduling for Future Publishing

Because the website is deployed in response to a commit to pulumi/docs `master`, it isn't possible to schedule a post to be released automatically at a precise date and time. (The `date` frontmatter property is used only for sorting and display purposes; it has no effect on whether or when a post gets published.) You can, however, influence the timing of the publishing process manually. See the [Merging and Releasing section of the README](README.md#merging-and-releasing) for details.

## Publishing Checklist

- [ ] Use `/new-blog-post` in Claude Code to create your post (or see [Appendix](#appendix-creating-blog-posts-manually) for manual method)
- [ ] Check for a break `<!--more-->` after the first paragraph, and ensure that your post's introduction looks right on the blog home page
- [ ] Run `/docs-review` to check for style and content issues
- [ ] Run `/add-borders` if your post includes images
- [ ] Check that your meta_image appears properly on the blog home page. Do not use animated GIFs for preview images
- [ ] Check that your meta_image is using the current logos for Pulumi and others
- [ ] Preview locally with `make serve`. Check formatting, links, and images for appearance
- [ ] Use the [Twitter card validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) to check how the blog appears in a tweet (use the preview provided in the PR)
- [ ] Reach out in [#blogs](https://pulumi.slack.com/archives/CCBFCGU94) to make Marketing aware that your post is about to go live!

## Appendix: Creating Blog Posts Manually

> **Note**: Most contributors should use the `/new-blog-post` command documented at the top of this guide. This section documents the manual process for reference or for contributors who don't have access to Claude Code.

### Manual Steps

1. Move onto a new branch for your blog post using `git checkout -b initials/your-blog-post` (replace initials with your initials, and replace your-blog-post with the name of your blog post).

1. Resist the temptation to copy-and-tweak an existing post! Instead, run the following command into the terminal (at the root of the project). This will generate a new file, including all the required frontmatter parameters.

   ```zsh
   make new-blog-post
   ```

   This will prompt you for a "slug" (a URL-friendly path) for your post and create a minimal post that you can browse to at http://localhost:1313/blog/. You'll find the new post's source file at `content/blog/[your-slug]/_index.md` containing the set of [Hugo front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) properties you'll need to get started:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "My New Post"
   date: 2019-07-17T14:26:50-07:00
   meta_image: meta.png
   authors:
       - joe-duffy
   tags:
       - some-tag
   ---
   ```

   Adjust the title and authors and add tags as appropriate (see the subsections below for more details). To change the post's URL, simply rename the folder containing `_index.md`; changing the folder name to `my-awesome-post`, for example, would result in a post ultimately published at https://www.pulumi.com/blog/my-awesome-post.

### Frontmatter Fields

**Title**

The `title` will populate the `<title>` tag of the page, the `<h1>`, and the display value if it is linked to internally. This field has a strict 60 character limit because of SEO related limitations. If you would like to have a longer display title (i.e. the `<h1>` tag) then you will need to specify it by adding `allow_long_title: True` to the front matter. If you would like to display different text on internal links than what the `title` value is, you can also specify a `linktitle` value. Both the `allow_long_title` and `linktitle` values can be of any length. Below is an example of this:

```yaml
---
title: This a Page Title
allow_long_title: true
linktitle: This is the link text
...
---
```

**Tags**

Every tag added makes the overall tagging system harder to quickly grok and use. So, we strongly prefer using existing tags wherever possible. The tag system is as follows:

- **Pulumi tags:** `pulumi-news` for company news (funding, certifications, etc.), `pulumi-events` for events we participate in or host, `pulumi-interns` for intern posts, `pulumi-enterprise` for enterprise-focused blog posts
- **Cloud provider tags:** Only add a cloud provider tag if we expect to have multiple posts about the provider. Today, that means `aws`, `azure`, `google-cloud`, `digitalocean`
- **Feature tags:** Only add a feature tag if we expect to have multiple posts about the feature. Today, that means `features` (for feature announcements), `aliases`, `continuous-delivery`, `logging`, `migration`, `native-providers`, `packages`, `policy-as-code`, `secrets`, `testing`.
- **Technology/scenario tags:** Similar to feature tags, but focused on user scenarios. Today, that means `cloud-engineering`, `cloud-native`, `containers`, `data-and-analytics`, `development-environment`, `github-actions`, `kubernetes`, `serverless`.
- **Language tags:** Any post that is language/ecosystem specific should have one or more of `.net`, `go`, `javascript`, `python`, `typescript`.

**Canonical link**

If you are posting a blog that originated somewhere else (for example, a syndicated community post) you will want to add the setting `canonical_url` for the URL where the blog post originated.

Additionally, if you're writing a blog post to announce a new product or feature that is also documented in our docs, you should set the `canonical_url` to point from the blog post to the relevant docs page. This helps consolidate optimization signals and ensures the docs page remains the primary source of truth in search engines.

**Schema type (structured data)**

Blog posts automatically get BlogPosting schema for SEO. You can optionally override this with `schema_type` in frontmatter if needed (rare). See [SCHEMA.md](./SCHEMA.md) for details.

### Creating Author Profiles

If you don't already have a [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file [in the `team` directory](https://github.com/pulumi/docs/tree/master/data/team/team) of the repo, create one now. For Pulumi employees, that file should look something like this (your `id` can be any string, but we recommend `firstname-lastname`):

```toml
id = "christian-nunciato"
name = "Christian Nunciato"
title = "Software Engineer"
status = "active"

[social]
github = "cnunciato"
linkedin = "cnunciato"
x = "cnunciato"
```

For community contributors, it's mostly the same, but with a `status` of `guest`, and a more informative `title`:

```toml
id = "mikhail-shilkov"
name = "Mikhail Shilkov"
title = "Microsoft Azure MVP and early Pulumi user"
status = "guest"
...
```

The `social` section, and the items within it, are optional.

Once your team-member file's been created, add your author image at [`static/images/team`](https://github.com/pulumi/docs/tree/master/static/images/team). The image should be a square JPG (400x400 max) named with your author `id` (e.g., `christian-nunciato.jpg`).

Update the new post's `authors` property to use your author `id`. If you're still running the development server, you should see the change reflected in the browser immediately.
