## Toolchain

The website is statically built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). So we have basic templating
for generating HTML and the ability to write most files in Markdown.

TypeScript documentation is generated directly from source using [TYPEDOC](http://typedoc.org/). We
just check the resulting files directly into the repo under `./packages/`.

## Development

Run `make configure` to get the required Gem dependencies. (Assuming you have a recent Ruby
installation on your system.

`make build` will generate the website (published to _site).

`make serve` will build the website and serve it to http://localhost:4000.

`make test` runs a broken link checker tool against http://localhost:4000.

`make generate` will regenerate the TypeScript documentation if needed, as well as the CLI documentation in [references/cli](reference/cli). The generated API documentation is placed in the [packages](packages/) folder. This is extremely hacky.

   Prerequisites:
  - Ensure that repos `pulumi`, `pulumi-aws`, and `pulumi-cloud` are peers to `docs`, and have been checked out to the right release branch.
  - Run `make only_build` in each of these repos
  - Install typedoc globally:
    ```npm install -g typedoc@0.8```
  - Patch typedoc so it doesn't bring its own version of TypeScript. For more information, see [this issue comment in typedoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc/issues/624#issuecomment-352897218). On a Mac:
    ```rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules/typedoc/node_modules/typescript/```
  - Install TypeScript globally:
    ```npm install -g typescript@2.6.2```

## Generating a change log

To generate a change log from closed pull requests, run the script `/scripts/generate_changelog.sh`. It generates a file using the rules documented here: [Planning, Work Items, and Changelog](https://github.com/pulumi/home/wiki/Planning,-Work-Items,-and-Changelog#tldr-minimal-label-requirements).

1. Run `./scripts/update_repos.sh` to pull down the latest tags for the repos `pulumi`, `pulumi-cloud`, `pulumi-aws`, `pulumi-terraform`, and `pulumi-azure`

1. Set the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to a token that has "repo" scope.

1. [Will be improved] Clone the repo at https://github.com/lindydonna/github-pr-changelog and run `npm i -g` to globally install the command `gh-changelog`.

1. Generate a change log with the following command:

    ```
    ./scripts/generate_changelog.sh <from-git-tag> <to-git-tag> > output.file
    ```

    You can also use the optional flags `--all-prs` to print out all PRs (not just ones with the relevant labels) and `--tab-output` to print in a format that can be pasted to a Google Sheet.
