                CIS compliance is crucial for establishing strong security controls and safeguarding your cloud
                infrastructure against cyber threats. Pulumi can help you identify
                existing cloud resources that are not in compliance, and it can also enforce compliance policies proactively
                before infrastructure is deployed. Get started with Pulumi to use these compliance tools or speak with a

            <h3>Key Aspects of CIS Compliance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Implementation of Controls:</strong> Start by implementing the
                    CIS Controls relevant to your organization's size and risk profile.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Use CIS Benchmarks:</strong> Configure your systems and
                    applications according to CIS Benchmarks.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Continuously monitor and audit your
                    systems to ensure ongoing compliance with CIS recommendations.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Automation Tools:</strong> Consider using CIS-CAT (CIS
                    Configuration Assessment Tool) or other automation tools to assess and
                    enforce compliance across your infrastructure.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Benefits of CIS Compliance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Standardized Security:</strong> Ensures that your organization
                    follows industry-recognized security best practices.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Risk Reduction:</strong> Helps in reducing the attack surface by
                    implementing critical security controls.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Compliance with Other Standards:</strong> CIS Controls and
                    Benchmarks often overlap with other compliance frameworks like PCI-DSS,
                    NIST, and ISO, making it easier to achieve multiple compliance goals
                    simultaneously.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Improved Incident Response:</strong> By implementing CIS
                    Controls, organizations are better equipped to detect, respond to, and
                    recover from security incidents.
                </li>
