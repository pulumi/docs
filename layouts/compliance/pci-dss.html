            <h3>Key Aspects of PCI DSS Compliance</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Security Controls:</strong> Organizations must implement
                    specific technical and operational security measures to safeguard
                    cardholder data. This includes requirements like installing
                    firewalls, encrypting cardholder data, and using antivirus software.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Access Control:</strong> Only authorized personnel should
                    have access to cardholder data. This involves setting up strong
                    access control measures, such as unique user IDs and restricting
                    physical access to sensitive data.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Monitoring and Testing:</strong> Regularly monitor and test
                    networks to ensure that security controls are functioning correctly
                    and to identify vulnerabilities. This includes maintaining logs of
                    all access to network resources and cardholder data.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Information Security Policy:</strong> Organizations must
                    maintain a policy that addresses information security for employees
                    and contractors. This includes regular security awareness training.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Organizations that process, store,
                    or transmit credit card information must undergo regular audits to
                    ensure they are in compliance with PCI DSS requirements. This can
                    involve self-assessment or external assessments, depending on the
                    size of the organization and the volume of transactions processed.

            <h3>12 PCI DSS Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                To ensure that your {{ .Params.full }} become PCI-DSS compliant, you'll need to
                adhere to the 12 PCI-DSS requirements. Here's a breakdown of what you need
                to do:
            </p>
            <h4>
                1. Install and Maintain a Firewall Configuration to Protect Cardholder Data
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Implement security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and
                    outbound traffic.
                </li>

                <li>Use VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to isolate and secure your network.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                2. Do Not Use Vendor-Supplied Defaults for System Passwords and Other
                Security Parameters
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Change all default passwords and settings on your servers,
                    databases, and other components.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to the
                    AWS console.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Protect Stored Cardholder Data</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Encrypt cardholder data using strong encryption (e.g., AES-256).</li>

                <li>
                    Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization (e.g.,
                    full track data, PINs).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>4. Encrypt Transmission of Cardholder Data Across Open, Public Networks</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use HTTPS/TLS to encrypt data in transit between your web app and users.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Ensure that all payment-related data transmissions are secured with
                    strong cryptographic protocols.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>5. Use and Regularly Update Anti-Virus Software or Programs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Install and maintain anti-virus/malware protection on your servers.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Regularly update your anti-virus software and perform scheduled scans.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>6. Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Applications</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Regularly update your web app and any third-party software or libraries.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Apply security patches promptly to your operating system and application
                    components.
                </li>

                <li>Conduct code reviews and vulnerability assessments of your web app.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>7. Restrict Access to Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to cardholder
                    data.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>8. Identify and Authenticate Access to System Components</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Implement strong authentication methods for accessing your applications.
                </li>

                <li>Enforce password complexity and expiration policies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>9. Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ensure that AWS physical security controls are adequate for the infrastructure
                    hosted in AWS.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Review AWS's compliance with physical security requirements as part of
                    their shared responsibility model.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                10. Track and Monitor All Access to Network Resources and Cardholder Data
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Enable CloudTrail and CloudWatch to log and monitor access to your AWS
                    resources.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Implement logging for your web app to track access to cardholder data.
                </li>

                <li>Regularly review logs and set up alerts for suspicious activity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>11. Regularly Test Security Systems and Processes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing on your
                    hosted applications.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Implement continuous monitoring and testing of your security systems.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
                12. Maintain a Policy That Addresses Information Security for All Personnel
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop and enforce an information security policy.</li>

                <li>
                    Train your staff on security practices and the importance of protecting
                    cardholder data.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Additional Considerations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Segmentation:</strong> Ensure that you properly segment your
                    environment to isolate cardholder data from other non-sensitive areas.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Compliance Documentation:</strong> Maintain records of all
                    compliance efforts, security measures, and audits for validation and
                    reporting purposes.
