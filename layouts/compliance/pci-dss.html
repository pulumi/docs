            <h3>Key Aspects of PCI DSS Compliance</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Security Controls:</strong> Organizations must implement
                    specific technical and operational security measures to safeguard
                    cardholder data. This includes requirements like installing
                    firewalls, encrypting cardholder data, and using antivirus software.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Access Control:</strong> Only authorized personnel should
                    have access to cardholder data. This involves setting up strong
                    access control measures, such as unique user IDs and restricting
                    physical access to sensitive data.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Monitoring and Testing:</strong> Regularly monitor and test
                    networks to ensure that security controls are functioning correctly
                    and to identify vulnerabilities. This includes maintaining logs of
                    all access to network resources and cardholder data.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Information Security Policy:</strong> Organizations must
                    maintain a policy that addresses information security for employees
                    and contractors. This includes regular security awareness training.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Organizations that process, store,
                    or transmit credit card information must undergo regular audits to
                    ensure they are in compliance with PCI DSS requirements. This can
                    involve self-assessment or external assessments, depending on the
                    size of the organization and the volume of transactions processed.
