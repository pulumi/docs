        <h3>Key Aspects of ISO 27001 Compliance</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Risk Management</strong>: ISO 27001 requires organizations to
                assess risks related to their information assets and implement controls
                to mitigate these risks.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Security Controls</strong>: The standard includes a
                comprehensive set of security controls (outlined in Annex A) that cover
                areas like access control, cryptography, physical security, and incident
                management.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>ISMS Implementation</strong>: Organizations must establish an
                ISMS, which is a systematic approach to managing sensitive company
                information so that it remains secure. This involves setting policies,
                procedures, and controls.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: ISO 27001 emphasizes the
                importance of continually monitoring, reviewing, and improving the ISMS
                to adapt to changing security risks and business needs.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Compliance and Certification</strong>: Organizations can seek
                certification to ISO 27001 by undergoing an external audit conducted by
                a certification body. Certification demonstrates that an organization
                has implemented best practices for information security management.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Legal and Regulatory Requirements</strong>: ISO 27001 helps
                organizations comply with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations
                related to information security.
            </li>
