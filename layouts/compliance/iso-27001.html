            <h3>What is ISO 27001 compliance?</h3>
            <p>
                ISO 27001 is an internationally recognized standard for managing information security. It
                provides a framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving
                an Information Security Management System (ISMS). The standard helps organizations manage and
                protect their information assets so that they remain secure, using a risk management approach.

            <h3>Key Aspects of ISO 27001 Compliance:</h3>
            <p>
                To make your {{ .Params.full }} in AWS compliant with ISO 27001, you need to align
                your information security management practices with the ISO 27001 standard.
                Below is a checklist to guide you through the necessary steps:
            </p>
            <h4>1. Establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Define the ISMS Scope:</strong> Determine the scope of your
                    ISMS, including which parts of your infrastructure, such as your {{ .Params.resource }}
                    instance, will be covered.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Develop Security Policies:</strong> Create and document
                    information security policies that align with ISO 27001 requirements.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Set Security Objectives:</strong> Define clear security
                    objectives and ensure they align with your organization's strategic
                    goals.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Conduct a Risk Assessment</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identify Information Assets:</strong> Identify all information
                    assets associated with your {{ .Params.full }}, such as data stored,
                    applications running, and network configurations.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Assess Risks:</strong> Perform a risk assessment to identify
                    potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the security of
                    your {{ .Params.full }}.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Risk Treatment Plan:</strong> Develop a risk treatment plan to
                    address identified risks, using ISO 27001's Annex A controls where
                    applicable.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Implement Security Controls</h4>
            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Conduct internal audits to assess the
                    effectiveness of the security controls and the ISMS in relation to your
                    {{ .Params.full }}.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Monitoring and Review:</strong> Regularly monitor security
                    metrics, review logs, and perform security reviews to ensure ongoing

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Maintain Documentation:</strong> Keep thorough records of your
                    security policies, risk assessments, treatment plans, audits, and any
                    changes to the ISMS.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Security Policy:</strong> Ensure that your security policy is
                    communicated to all relevant stakeholders and is reviewed regularly.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By following these steps, you'll align your {{ .Params.full }} with ISO 27001
                requirements and help ensure the security of your information assets.
