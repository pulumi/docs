            <h3>What is Container Management?</h3>
            <p>
                Docker, and containers more generally, transformed the way that developers could build, ship, and run applications. As a standardized unit of delivery, containers
                have all of the libraries, code, and runtime knowledge they need to work, and so can be deployed and scaled into any environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                For DevOps teams, container management is an important capability whether delivering containers into bespoke environments, or more likely through a managed cloud
                offering such as AWS Fargate, AWS ECS, and Microsoft ACI, or through Kubernetes - either on-premises or AWS EKS, Microsoft AKS, or Google GKE.

            <h3>Deploying containers with Pulumi</h3>
            <p>
                Container management solutions are broadly split into two options: low-management solutions for ease of deployment, and Kubernetes-based solutions for complete
                control.
            </p>
            <h4>Low Cluster Management</h4>
            <p>
                AWS Fargate, and Microsoft ACI are examples of services that enable the deployment of containers without having to manage servers or clusters. This means teams can
                very easily build container applications and deploy them into production without worrying about infrastructure, but gaining the benefits of seamless scaling.
            </p>
            <h4>Kubernetes Management</h4>
            <p>
                While running Kubernetes on-premises is a viable, and well-used solution, the major cloud vendors also offer Kubernetes sevices: Amazon EKS, Microsoft AKS, and
                Google GKE.
            </p>
            <p>Pulumi makes it simple to interact with any of the services available from the major cloud vendors, and with Kubernetes.</p>
