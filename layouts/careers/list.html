                Pulumi is reinventing how people build modern cloud applications, with a unique platform that combines deep systems and infrastructure innovation with elegant
                programming models and developer tools.

            <p>
                Our team is a diverse and talented group of individuals, with backgrounds in distributed cloud systems, programming languages, developer tools, and operating
                systems, from companies from all corners of the industry. Our culture is one of technical excellence, passion for teamwork, and customer obsession.

                While we have a fabulous office in downtown Seattle, Pulumi cares about the health, safety and happiness of our employees, and we've been a fully remote company
                since March, 2020. We've learned and grown as a company this year, and &mdash; unless otherwise specified &mdash; all of our open positions are remote. We will
                continue to collaborate and grow from different locations, and are committed to making sure our team is successful from their home offices.
