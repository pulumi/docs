    This shortcode is used to render markdown inside HTML tags, which Blackfriday,
    the markdown processor that Hugo uses, doesn't currently support.
    We specify version = 1 so that `.Inner` is rendered as markdown consistently,
    whether it ends up being within HTML tags or not.
    See https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#shortcodes-with-markdown.
