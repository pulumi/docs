<p>Let's remove the cloud resources that have been provisioned.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Run {{ "`pulumi destroy`" | markdownify }} to tear down all resources.</li>
    <li>To delete the stack itself, run {{ "`pulumi stack rm`" | markdownify }}. Note that this command deletes all deployment history from the Pulumi Console.</li>
</ol>
