        Pulumi's infrastructure-as-code SDK helps you create, deploy, and manage {{ .Get 0 }} containers, serverless functions, and infrastructure using programming languages like
        TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, and Java, and markup languages like YAML. The Pulumi {{ .Get 0 }} provider packages and CLI help you accomplish all these within minutes.
    </p>
    <p>For a quick example of how Pulumi deploys infrastructure on {{ .Get 0 }}, this tutorial takes you through the following steps to easily deploy a static website:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Setting up and configuring Pulumi to access your {{ .Get 0 }} account.</li>
        <li>Creating a new Pulumi project.</li>
        {{ if eq $cloud "AWS" }}
            <li>Provisioning a new AWS S3 bucket.</li>
            <li>Adding an <code>index.html</code> file to the bucket and serving it as a static website.</li>
        {{ else if eq $cloud "Microsoft Azure" }}
            <li>Provisioning a new Blob storage container.</li>
            <li>Adding an <code>index.html</code> file to your container and serving it as a static website.</li>
        {{ else if eq $cloud "Google Cloud" }}
            <li>Provisioning a new Google Cloud Storage bucket.</li>
            <li>Adding an <code>index.html</code> file to your bucket and serving it as a static website.</li>
        {{ end }}
        <li>Cleaning up your deployment by destroying the resources you've provisioned.</li>
    </ol>
