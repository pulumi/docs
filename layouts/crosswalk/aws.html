        <h3>Well-Architected Infrastructure as Code for AWS</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to build modern applications on AWS &mdash; from development to production.</p>
        <p>
            Build and deploy modern cloud architectures on AWS quickly using reusable, well-architected patterns with infrastructure as code. Available in TypeScript/JavaScript,
            Python, Go, .NET, Java, and YAML.

                            Provision services that are Well-Architected by default. Benefit from patterns that worked for customers who have gone to production. Easy to get
                            started, and easy to do the right thing.

                        Get up and running on "day one" with containers -- using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), including "Fargate" or Kubernetes (EKS) -- or serverless --
                        using AWS Lambda or API Gateway. Benefit from secure and reliable defaults, and customize only where you need to.

                    <h3>Secure, Scalable, and Observable Architectures</h3>
                    <p>
                        Create, manage, and integrate "day two and beyond" infrastructure for security (e.g., IAM), networking (e.g., VPC), scaling (e.g., Auto Scaling, ELB), and
                        monitoring (e.g., CloudWatch and CloudWatch Logs). Instead of relearning best practices time and time again, use hardened packages that automatically
                        encapsulate Well-Architected patterns and practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pulumi's unique approach to infrastructure as code means you can leverage highly configurable and extensible components to enforce best practices within
                        your team.

                        We've been happily using Pulumi's EKS support for more than three months now. Our team was looking for an end-to-end solution to tame the complexity of
                        Kubernetes on AWS and ensure we adhere to AWS best practices. Pulumi's Crosswalk effort has equipped our team to scale far better than the alternative
                        approaches of home-grown solutions, scripts and DSLs. Our delivery is now automated and we can now deliver new application and infrastructure features with
                        much faster turn-around, sometimes in just a few hours. Pulumi is a key contributor to our team's improvement in productivity.
