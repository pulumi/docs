                <h3>Real Code</h3>
                <p>
                    Pulumi is infrastructure as real code. This means you get all the benefits
                    of your favorite language and tool for provisioning cloud infrastructure:
                    code completion, error checking, versioning, IDE support, and general
                    productivity gains &mdash; without the need to manage YAML and DSL syntax.

                <h3>Familiar Constructs</h3>
                <p>
                    Real languages means you get familiar constructs like for loops,
                    functions, and classes - cutting boilerplate and enforcing best
                    practices. Pulumi lets you leverage existing package management tools
                    and techniques.

                <h3>Ephemeral Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>
                    Pulumi has deep support for cloud native technologies, like
                    Kubernetes, and supports advanced deployment scenarios that cannot be
                    expressed with Terraform. Pulumi is a proud member of the Cloud Native
                    Computing Foundation (CNCF).

                <h3>TF Provider Integration</h3>
                <p>
                    Pulumi is able to adapt any Terraform Provider for use with Pulumi,
                    enabling management of any infrastructure supported by the Terraform
                    Providers ecosystem using Pulumi programs.
