    <h3>12 PCI DSS Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        To ensure that your {{ .Params.full }} become PCI-DSS compliant, you'll need to
        adhere to the 12 PCI-DSS requirements. Here's a breakdown of what you need
        to do:
    </p>
    <h4>
        1. Install and Maintain a Firewall Configuration to Protect Cardholder Data
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Implement security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and
            outbound traffic.
        </li>

        <li>Use VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to isolate and secure your network.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        2. Do Not Use Vendor-Supplied Defaults for System Passwords and Other
        Security Parameters
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Change all default passwords and settings on your servers,
            databases, and other components.
        </li>

        <li>
            Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to the
            AWS console.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Protect Stored Cardholder Data</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Encrypt cardholder data using strong encryption (e.g., AES-256).</li>

        <li>
            Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization (e.g.,
            full track data, PINs).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. Encrypt Transmission of Cardholder Data Across Open, Public Networks</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Use HTTPS/TLS to encrypt data in transit between your web app and users.
        </li>

        <li>
            Ensure that all payment-related data transmissions are secured with
            strong cryptographic protocols.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>5. Use and Regularly Update Anti-Virus Software or Programs</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Install and maintain anti-virus/malware protection on your servers.
        </li>

        <li>
            Regularly update your anti-virus software and perform scheduled scans.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>6. Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Applications</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Regularly update your web app and any third-party software or libraries.
        </li>

        <li>
            Apply security patches promptly to your operating system and application
            components.
        </li>

        <li>Conduct code reviews and vulnerability assessments of your web app.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>7. Restrict Access to Cardholder Data by Business Need to Know</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to cardholder
            data.
        </li>

        <li>
            Ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>8. Identify and Authenticate Access to System Components</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Implement strong authentication methods for accessing your applications.
        </li>

        <li>Enforce password complexity and expiration policies.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>9. Restrict Physical Access to Cardholder Data</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Ensure that AWS physical security controls are adequate for the infrastructure
            hosted in AWS.
        </li>

        <li>
            Review AWS's compliance with physical security requirements as part of
            their shared responsibility model.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        10. Track and Monitor All Access to Network Resources and Cardholder Data
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Enable CloudTrail and CloudWatch to log and monitor access to your AWS
            resources.
        </li>

        <li>
            Implement logging for your web app to track access to cardholder data.
        </li>

        <li>Regularly review logs and set up alerts for suspicious activity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>11. Regularly Test Security Systems and Processes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing on your
            hosted applications.
        </li>

        <li>
            Implement continuous monitoring and testing of your security systems.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        12. Maintain a Policy That Addresses Information Security for All Personnel
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Develop and enforce an information security policy.</li>

        <li>
            Train your staff on security practices and the importance of protecting
            cardholder data.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Additional Considerations:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Segmentation:</strong> Ensure that you properly segment your
            environment to isolate cardholder data from other non-sensitive areas.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Compliance Documentation:</strong> Maintain records of all
            compliance efforts, security measures, and audits for validation and
            reporting purposes.
        </li>
    </ul>
