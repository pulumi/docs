    <h3>ISO 27001 Compliance for your Azure Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
        To make your Azure cloud infrastructure compliant with ISO 27001, you need
        to align your information security management practices with the ISO 27001
        standard. Below is a checklist to guide you through the necessary steps:
    </p>

    <h4>1. Establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Define the ISMS Scope</strong>: Determine the scope of your
            ISMS, specifying which parts of your Azure infrastructure will be
            covered.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Develop Security Policies</strong>: Create and document
            information security policies that align with ISO 27001 requirements,
            tailored to your Azure resources.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Set Security Objectives</strong>: Define clear security
            objectives that align with your organization's strategic goals and the
            capabilities of Azure.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Conduct a Risk Assessment</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Identify Information Assets</strong>: Identify all information
            assets associated with your Azure cloud infrastructure, including data
            storage, running applications, and network configurations.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Assess Risks</strong>: Perform a risk assessment to identify
            potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the security of
            your Azure cloud infrastructure.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Risk Treatment Plan</strong>: Develop a risk treatment plan to
            address identified risks using ISO 27001's Annex A controls, applying
            them where applicable to Azure services.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Implement Security Controls</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Access Control</strong>: Ensure that access to your Azure cloud
            infrastructure is restricted to authorized personnel. Use
            <strong>Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> to enforce least
            privilege access.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Encryption</strong>: Encrypt data at rest and in transit. Use
            <strong>Azure Key Vault</strong> to manage encryption keys, and ensure
            that HTTPS/TLS is enabled for secure communication.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong>: Enable
            <strong>Azure Monitor</strong>, <strong>Azure Security Center</strong>,
            and <strong>NSG Flow Logs</strong> to track access and activity on your
            Azure cloud infrastructure. Regularly review logs for suspicious
            activity.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Backups and Recovery</strong>: Implement automated backups using
            <strong>Azure Backup</strong> or
            <strong>Azure Site Recovery</strong> and ensure that recovery procedures
            are documented and tested.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. Leadership and Commitment</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Management Support</strong>: Ensure that senior management is
            involved in supporting the ISMS. They should provide necessary resources
            and demonstrate commitment to information security.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Define Roles and Responsibilities</strong>: Clearly define and
            document the roles and responsibilities of personnel involved in
            managing Azure infrastructure and information security.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>5. Awareness and Training</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Security Awareness Training</strong>: Provide regular training
            to personnel on information security best practices and ISO 27001
            requirements specific to Azure.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Competency Development</strong>: Ensure that personnel have the
            necessary skills and knowledge to manage the Azure cloud infrastructure
            securely.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>6. Operational Security</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Patch Management</strong>: Regularly update and patch the
            operating systems, applications, and dependencies running on your Azure
            infrastructure using tools like
            <strong>Azure Update Management</strong>.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Configuration Management</strong>: Securely configure your Azure
            resources, following best practices like
            <strong>Azure Security Benchmark</strong> to reduce attack surfaces
            (e.g., disabling unnecessary services, limiting administrative access).
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Incident Response</strong>: Develop and document an incident
            response plan using <strong>Azure Sentinel</strong>. Ensure that you can
            detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents within your
            Azure environment.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>7. Supplier Management</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Third-Party Risks</strong>: Ensure that any third-party services
            you use (e.g., for payment processing or backups) are also compliant
            with ISO 27001 or have robust security measures in place.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Service Level Agreements (SLAs)</strong>: Establish SLAs with
            third-party providers that include information security requirements and
            ensure compliance with ISO 27001.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>8. Performance Evaluation</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Regular Audits</strong>: Conduct internal audits to assess the
            effectiveness of your security controls and the ISMS in relation to your
            Azure infrastructure resources.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Monitoring and Review</strong>: Regularly monitor security
            metrics, review logs, and perform security reviews using tools like
            <strong>Azure Security Center</strong> to ensure ongoing compliance.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>9. Continuous Improvement</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Corrective Actions</strong>: When non-conformities are
            identified during audits or security incidents, take corrective actions
            to address them and prevent recurrence.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>ISMS Improvement</strong>: Continuously improve the ISMS by
            updating policies, procedures, and controls based on lessons learned and
            evolving risks.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>10. Certification</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>External Audit</strong>: Engage an accredited certification body
            to conduct an audit of your ISMS. The audit will typically involve a
            documentation review (Stage 1) followed by an assessment of control
            implementations (Stage 2) in your Azure environment.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Surveillance Audits</strong>: After achieving certification,
            prepare for regular surveillance audits to ensure ongoing compliance
            with ISO 27001.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>11. Documentation</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Maintain Documentation</strong>: Keep thorough records of
            security policies, risk assessments, treatment plans, audits, and any
            changes to the ISMS. Use <strong>Azure DevOps</strong> or other
            documentation tools to track changes.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Security Policy</strong>: Ensure that your security policy is
            communicated to relevant stakeholders and reviewed regularly to maintain
            alignment with ISO 27001.
        </li>
    </ul>
