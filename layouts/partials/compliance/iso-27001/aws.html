    <h3>ISO 27001 Compliance for your AWS infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
        To make your {{ .Params.full }} compliant with ISO 27001, you need to align
        your information security management practices with the ISO 27001 standard.
        Below is a checklist to guide you through the necessary steps:
    </p>
    <h4>1. Establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Define the ISMS Scope:</strong> Determine the scope of your
            ISMS, including which parts of your infrastructure will be covered.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Develop Security Policies:</strong> Create and document
            information security policies that align with ISO 27001 requirements.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Set Security Objectives:</strong> Define clear security
            objectives and ensure they align with your organization's strategic
            goals.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Conduct a Risk Assessment</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Identify Information Assets:</strong> Identify all information
            assets associated with your {{ .Params.full }}, such as data stored,
            applications running, and network configurations.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Assess Risks:</strong> Perform a risk assessment to identify
            potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the security of
            your {{ .Params.full }}.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Risk Treatment Plan:</strong> Develop a risk treatment plan to
            address identified risks, using ISO 27001's Annex A controls where
            applicable.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Implement Security Controls</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Access Control:</strong> Ensure that access to your {{ .Params.full }}
            is restricted to authorized personnel only. Use AWS Identity and Access
            Management (IAM) to enforce least privilege access.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Encryption:</strong> Encrypt data at rest and in transit. Use
            AWS services like AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and enable HTTPS/TLS
            for secure communication.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Logging and Monitoring:</strong> Enable CloudTrail, AWS Config,
            and VPC Flow Logs to monitor access and activity on your {{ .Params.full }}.
            Regularly review logs for any suspicious activity.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Backups and Recovery:</strong> Implement automated backups of
            your data and ensure that recovery procedures are in place. Use services
            like AWS Backup or snapshots.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. Leadership and Commitment</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Management Support:</strong> Ensure that senior management is
            involved and supports the ISMS. They should provide the necessary
            resources and demonstrate commitment to information security.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Define Roles and Responsibilities:</strong> Clearly define and
            document the roles and responsibilities of personnel involved in
            managing your infrastructure and information security.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>5. Awareness and Training</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> Provide regular training
            to all personnel involved on information security best practices and
            ISO 27001 requirements.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Competency Development:</strong> Ensure that personnel have the
            necessary skills and knowledge to manage the {{ .Params.full }} securely.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>6. Operational Security</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Patch Management:</strong> Regularly update and patch the
            operating system, applications, and any dependencies running on your
            {{ .Params.full }}.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Configuration Management:</strong> Securely configure your
            {{ .Params.full }}, following best practices for reducing attack
            surfaces, such as disabling unnecessary services and restricting administrative access.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Incident Response:</strong> Develop and document an incident
            response plan. Ensure that you can quickly detect, respond to, and
            recover from security incidents involving your {{ .Params.full }}.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>7. Supplier Management</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Third-Party Risks:</strong> Ensure that any third-party services
            you use (e.g., for payment processing or backups) are also compliant
            with ISO 27001 or have robust security measures in place.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Service Level Agreements (SLAs):</strong> Establish SLAs that
            include information security requirements with third-party providers.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>8. Performance Evaluation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Conduct internal audits to assess the
            effectiveness of the security controls and the ISMS in relation to your
            {{ .Params.full }} resources.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Monitoring and Review:</strong> Regularly monitor security
            metrics, review logs, and perform security reviews to ensure ongoing
            compliance.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>9. Continuous Improvement</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Corrective Actions:</strong> When non-conformities are
            identified (e.g., during an audit or security incident), take corrective
            actions to address them and prevent recurrence.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>ISMS Improvement:</strong> Continuously improve the ISMS by
            updating policies, procedures, and controls based on lessons learned and
            changing risk landscapes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>10. Certification</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>External Audit:</strong> Engage an accredited certification body
            to conduct an audit of your ISMS. This process typically involves a
            documentation review (Stage 1) followed by an assessment of the
            implementation of controls (Stage 2).
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Surveillance Audits:</strong> After achieving certification, be
            prepared for regular surveillance audits to ensure continued compliance
            with ISO 27001.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>11. Documentation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Maintain Documentation:</strong> Keep thorough records of your
            security policies, risk assessments, treatment plans, audits, and any
            changes to the ISMS.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Security Policy:</strong> Ensure that your security policy is
            communicated to all relevant stakeholders and is reviewed regularly.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By following these steps, you'll align your {{ .Params.full }} with ISO 27001
        requirements and help ensure the security of your information assets.
        Remember that achieving ISO 27001 compliance is an ongoing process,
        requiring regular reviews and updates to your ISMS.
