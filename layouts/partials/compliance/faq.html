                <p>Pulumi takes a policy-as-code approach to cloud compliance, enabling organizations to define, enforce, and audit compliance requirements programmatically. Through Pulumi CrossGuard policies, Insights for continuous monitoring, and pre-built compliance packs for PCI DSS, CIS, and ISO 27001, Pulumi helps ensure cloud infrastructure stays compliant across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Which compliance standards does Pulumi support?</h3>
                <p>Pulumi supports major compliance frameworks including PCI DSS for payment card security, CIS Benchmarks for system security configuration, and ISO 27001 for information security management. Pulumi's pre-built policy packs cover hundreds of controls across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud services, with continuous updates to match evolving compliance requirements.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How does policy as code help with compliance?</h3>
                <p>Policy as code transforms compliance from manual checklists to automated, enforceable rules. Pulumi's policy-as-code approach prevents non-compliant resources from being deployed, provides continuous monitoring of existing infrastructure, and generates audit-ready reports. This automation reduces human error, ensures consistent application of compliance controls, and simplifies audit preparation.</p>

                    <p>AWS infrastructure has PCI DSS certification for its underlying platform, but customers must ensure their own AWS configurations meet PCI requirements. Each AWS service used in a cardholder data environment must be properly configured with encryption, access controls, and monitoring. Pulumi helps enforce these configurations through policy as code and pre-built compliance rules.</p>
