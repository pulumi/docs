    <h3>CIS Compliance for your Azure Infrastructure</h3>
    <h4>1. Identity and Access Management (Azure AD)</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Root Account Protection</strong>: Ensure that the Azure
            subscription's root account (Global Administrator) is not used for
            everyday tasks and that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for
            this account.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Policies</strong>: Apply the
            principle of least privilege by ensuring that RBAC roles grant the
            minimum permissions required for users, groups, and services.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>MFA for Azure AD Users</strong>: Require MFA for all Azure AD
            users with Azure portal access.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Password Policies</strong>: Implement strong password policies
            in Azure AD, including complexity requirements, password expiration, and
            self-service password reset options.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Logging and Monitoring</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Azure Activity Logs</strong>: Enable
            <strong>Azure Activity Logs</strong> across all regions to record all
            management-level operations on your resources. Ensure logs are archived
            in <strong>Azure Storage</strong> with encryption and immutability for
            added security.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Azure Monitor</strong>: Set up <strong>Azure Monitor</strong> to
            track key metrics and create alerts for unusual activities, resource
            utilization, or threshold breaches.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>NSG Flow Logs</strong>: Enable
            <strong>Network Security Group (NSG) Flow Logs</strong> to capture
            information about IP traffic to and from resources within your Virtual
            Network (VNet).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Networking</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>NSGs and ASGs</strong>: Ensure that your
            <strong>Network Security Groups (NSGs)</strong> and
            <strong>Application Security Groups (ASGs)</strong> are configured to
            allow only necessary traffic. Regularly review and restrict inbound and
            outbound rules.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Public Access to Resources</strong>: Avoid public access to
            sensitive resources. Ensure that no NSGs or Public IP addresses allow
            unrestricted access (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0) unless explicitly required and
            properly monitored.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Jumpbox VMs</strong>: Use
            <strong>Jumpbox Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong> for secure SSH or RDP
            access to resources. These should be the only publicly accessible VMs
            and tightly controlled.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. Encryption</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Azure Storage Encryption</strong>: Ensure that all
            <strong>Azure Storage accounts</strong> (Blob, File, Table, Queue) use
            server-side encryption (SSE) to protect data at rest. Enable default
            encryption for all new storage accounts.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Azure SQL Database and Managed Disk Encryption</strong>: Enable
            encryption for <strong>Azure SQL Databases</strong> and
            <strong>Azure Managed Disks</strong>, including data at rest, backups,
            and transparent data encryption (TDE).
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Azure Key Vault</strong>: Use
            <strong>Azure Key Vault</strong> to manage and rotate encryption keys.
            Ensure that access to Key Vault keys is restricted through RBAC and
            monitored with audit logs.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>5. Auditing and Assessment Tools</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Azure Policy</strong>: Use <strong>Azure Policy</strong> to
            assess, audit, and enforce the configuration of your Azure resources.
            Set up compliance policies that align with
            <strong>CIS Benchmarks</strong> and trigger alerts for non-compliance.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Azure Security Center</strong>: Enable
            <strong>Azure Security Center</strong> to aggregate security findings,
            compare them against best practices, and offer recommendations. Security
            Center also helps monitor compliance and generate reports.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>CIS-CAT Tool</strong>: Use the
            <strong>CIS Configuration Assessment Tool (CIS-CAT)</strong> to automate
            the assessment of your Azure environment against the
            <strong>CIS Benchmarks</strong>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>6. Automation and Continuous Compliance</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong>: Use tools like
            <strong>Pulumi</strong> to define your infrastructure as code. This
            ensures that CIS-compliant configurations are applied consistently and
            efficiently across environments.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Automated Remediation</strong>: Implement automated remediation
            for non-compliant resources using <strong>Azure Automation</strong> or
            <strong>Azure Policy</strong> to enforce continuous compliance.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong>: Regularly monitor your
            environment with tools like <strong>Azure Monitor</strong>,
            <strong>Azure Policy</strong>, and <strong>Azure Sentinel</strong> to
            ensure ongoing compliance with CIS benchmarks.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>7. Documentation and Reporting</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Compliance Documentation</strong>: Maintain up-to-date
            documentation of your CIS compliance efforts, including policies,
            configurations, and monitoring setups in your
            <strong>Azure DevOps</strong> or documentation repositories.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Regular Audits</strong>: Schedule regular internal audits using
            <strong>Azure Compliance Manager</strong> to review configurations
            against the CIS benchmarks and update them as necessary.
        </li>
    </ul>
