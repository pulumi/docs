    <h3>CIS Compliance for your AWS Infrastructure</h3>
    <h4>1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Root Account Protection:</strong> Ensure that the AWS root
            account is not used for everyday tasks and that Multi-Factor
            Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the root account.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>IAM Policies:</strong> Apply the principle of least privilege by
            ensuring that IAM policies grant the minimum permissions required for
            users, roles, and services.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>MFA for IAM Users:</strong> Require MFA for all IAM users with
            console access.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Password Policies:</strong> Implement strong password policies
            for IAM users, including complexity requirements and password
            expiration.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Logging and Monitoring</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>CloudTrail:</strong> Enable AWS CloudTrail across all regions to
            log all API activity in your AWS account. Ensure logs are sent to an S3
            bucket with encryption and that the bucket is protected against
            deletion.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>CloudWatch:</strong> Set up CloudWatch to monitor critical
            metrics and create alarms for unusual activities or threshold breaches.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>VPC Flow Logs:</strong> Enable VPC Flow Logs to capture
            information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in
            your VPC.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Networking</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Security Groups and NACLs:</strong> Ensure that your Security
            Groups and Network ACLs (NACLs) are configured to allow only necessary
            traffic. Review and restrict inbound and outbound rules.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Public Access to Resources:</strong> Avoid public access to
            sensitive resources. Ensure that no security groups allow unrestricted
            access (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0) unless explicitly required and monitored.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Bastion Hosts:</strong> Use bastion hosts for SSH or RDP access
            to instances, ensuring that they are the only publicly accessible
            resources and are tightly controlled.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. Encryption</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>S3 Bucket Encryption:</strong> Ensure that all S3 buckets use
            server-side encryption (SSE) to protect data at rest. Enable default
            encryption for all new buckets.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>RDS and EBS Encryption:</strong> Enable encryption for Amazon
            RDS databases and Amazon EBS volumes, both for data at rest and backups.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Key Management Service (KMS):</strong> Use AWS KMS to manage and
            rotate encryption keys. Ensure that access to KMS keys is restricted and
            monitored.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>5. Auditing and Assessment Tools</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>AWS Config:</strong> Use AWS Config to assess, audit, and
            evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Set up rules to
            automatically check for compliance with CIS benchmarks and trigger
            alerts for non-compliance.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>AWS Security Hub:</strong> Enable AWS Security Hub to aggregate
            security findings and compare them against CIS Benchmarks. Security Hub
            can also automatically generate compliance reports.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>CIS-CAT Tool:</strong> Use the CIS Configuration Assessment Tool
            (CIS-CAT) to automate the assessment of your AWS environment against the
            CIS Benchmarks.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>6. Automation and Continuous Compliance</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC):</strong> Use tools like AWS
            CloudFormation or Terraform to define your infrastructure in code. This
            allows you to apply CIS-compliant configurations consistently and easily
            across your environments.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Automated Remediation:</strong> Implement automated remediation
            for non-compliant resources using AWS Lambda or AWS Config rules to
            enforce compliance.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Regularly monitor your
            environment with tools like AWS Config, CloudWatch, and GuardDuty to
            ensure ongoing compliance with CIS benchmarks.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>7. Documentation and Reporting</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Compliance Documentation:</strong> Maintain documentation of
            your CIS compliance efforts, including configurations, policies, and
            monitoring setups.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Schedule regular internal audits to
            review your configurations against the CIS benchmarks and update them as
            needed.
        </li>
    </ul>
