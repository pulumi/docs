<!--
    These two scripts are provided separately in order to allow browsers to decide which
    component bundle to load. Modern browsers that support web components will load the
    smaller bundle. Others will load the (much larger) polyfill. Because they're ultimately
    responsible for loading child components, whose filenames will contain content-based
    hashes, they must not be cached.
